Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Court, Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the 70th Session of the Minnesota Legislature, fellow constitutional officers, distinguished guests, and fellow citizens:

This is the beginning of my eighth full day as Governor of Minnesota. It's my first opportunity to appear before you.

Some of you have been my friends and colleagues in Minnesota state government for as long as fourteen years.

You have shared the burden--and satisfaction--of making this the most progressive and successful state in the union.

To those of you who are here for the first time, as new members of this outstanding Legislative body, I say "Welcome".

To the veteran Legislators in this Assembly, and to your 1eaders, I say "Well done".

This is the hardest working, most productive Legislature in the nation. And in terms of records of accomplishments, it is one of the most underpaid.


As one with a deep interest in Minnesota history I can tell you today that we have never had a Governor who has accomplished more than Wendell Anderson.

And we never had a Legislature that made as big a mark on the life of Minnesota people as you have made in the past four years.

It is now our challenge to continue that remarkable record.

I'm not here today to layout a detailed Legislative program or budget. We will be back in this Chamber in twenty days to begin that task. Today I simply want to tell you how I feel about Minnesota, our government and our people.

This nation has just ended its Bicentennial year. It is not a conclusion, it is just a beginning.

In this first year of America's third century it is time to look ahead to what the future holds for the people of our state. I know our people and I am optimistic.

As Minnesota's chairman of the Bicentennial I have traveled to more Minnesota communities and met more Minnesota citizens than any other elected official in our 119-year history. They have taught me the meaning of the Minnesota spirit.

The people of this state are an inexhaustible resource of faith and optimism! pride and high expectations. They try hard. They work hard. They look forward to better lives for themselves! their children! and to those who haven't been so fortunate.
Our people are committed to education and to opportunity. They believe you can succeed if you work at it.
They know Minnesota is not perfect. But they think we do better than just about anybody else. They are proud of the Minnesota effort to build and maintain a high quality of life. They support the Minnesota partnership for progress--with personal effort and the hard cash of their tax dollars. And they expect their leaders to live up to their promises and live up to their ability. We can do that and now is the time to begin.
Minnesota is just emerging from a damaging national recession. Our economy has done better than the nation's. Our unemployment is far below the national average. Our state budget is balanced. And our state credit is good.
But too many Minnesota workers still do not have jobs. And a savage unrelenting drought has struck a tragic blow to farm families! the communities! and our vital farm economy.
Raging forest fires have severely damaged our important timber! resort and outdoor recreational industries.

The most important thing we have to do this year is to put people back to work. 

And we can do that.

First, through an even stronger state housing effort, to create productive jobs for construction workers and help people find decent places to 1ive.

Second, through the Governor's Task Force on drought aid
we established last week, to bring state and federal resources to
bear on the immediate problems of our farmers.

Third, through using special resources to provide temporary work for farm families and others in need of help.

Today I am announcing a special $2 million work program for hard-pressed farm families in our worst drought areas. We will use federal funds from the 1976 Public Works Employment Act. We will offer public service jobs for up to 15 weeks at prevailing wages. The Governor1s Manpower Office and the State Department of Agriculture will put this program into operation this week.

These are not state government jobs. They will not affect our state budget. But they are a responsible and productive way to make use of federal help.

These temporary jobs will help our farm area families who are suffering the most. They will help farmers through the winter to spring planting time. And that is what we must do.

Fourth, we can, and must, do much more to develop good economic information and sound economic planning in Minnesota. In the long run, that is how we can insure permanent jobs and stable economic growth.
We can do better. And I will ask the Minnesota State Planning Agency to see that we do.
Fifth, our state is already a research and development center for electronics, computer technology and agriculture. Expanding our knowledge has meant expanded job opportunities. As one example, the University of Minnesota developed a way to use low-grade ore, revitalized the mining industry and created thousands of jobs.
The main emphasis of my message today is jobs. But we can also do better in health.
The state is blessed with many of the best health care resources in the nation.
We have excellent professional training. We work hard to improve the environment in which our people live. And we have superior health facilities.
But we are missing some great opportunities. Health care costs are too high. We don't put enough emphasis on illness prevention, on physical fitness or active recreation. We should do more in making progress against serious and crippling diseases.

We have made many important state commitments in the past six years. This year we need to dedicate a portion of our human and financial resources to finding some of the answers to better health care for more people.
Every dollar of our investment will bring five six or seven additional dollars of federal private and foundation funds. I believe we can keep such a commitment and I hope you will help me do it.
Minnesota's environmental quality and energy crisis also demands our serious attention.
The Dakota Indians named the state Minnesota -- "Minne" for water and "Sota" for white.
The Indians understood the environment, lived it and loved
it.
Perhaps the most tragic story of all in our decades of environmental exploitation is the story of how we destroyed the land the independence and the way of life of American Indians who preceded us by centuries on this land.

This administration will give special emphasis to improving state services for Indians. My recommendations will be included in the state budget.

Jobs are a major concern for all of us. And there is no need to abuse the environment to protect jobs. In fact, Minnesota history shows that the destruction of our natural resources means the destruction of industries that put people to work.
Our first major industry in what we now call Minnesota was furs. There were more than 150 fur outposts in Minnesota.
In that era, our leaders thought there was no end ever to the fur-bearing animals. They would continue to multiply no matter how many pelts were taken.
Wars were fought over the fur industry. This area, in fact, was colonized because of its fur-bearing animals.
There was no thought of tomorrow, and so those animals were destroyed and, in fact, they're just starting to come back.
Less than a century ago, miles and miles of white pine stretched all the way from southeastern Minnesota to the Canadian border. Thousands were employed as mill hands and lumberjacks in a great timber industry.
Our leaders in the 1880's were convinced there was no end to the white pine industry in Minnesota.
And most of those early lumberjacks were farmers. They harvested crops in the fall, trees in the winter.

Farmers planted crops, but nobody planted trees. Government could have required that one section be replanted as soon as cutting started on another. If that had been the law, we might still have a white pine industry in Minnesota, and majestic white pine trees today.
But no one made them do it. And 67 billion board feet of lumber left Minnesota. So did a major industry, and the jobs that went with it.
Commercial fishing is the same story. That industry in Minnesota, for all practical purposes, is gone--because nobody thought ahead.
When the fish are gone, the jobs are gone. When the trees are gone, the jobs are gone. And when the fur-bearing animals are gone, the jobs are gone.
Minnesota!s natural iron ore took 1.5 billion years to form. In one person's lifetime-~75 years--we mined all the natural ore in Minnesota. Nothing was done to preserve the environment in Northern Minnesota.
Minnesota's natural ore mines employed many more people than we have working now in the taconite industry. When the natural ore was gone, the jobs were gone.
If we had just had Legislative mine-land reclamation, there would be more jobs in Minnesota--jobs that restore and enhance our environment. Those jobs could be with us today.

Page 9
Only one state in the union has done less in mine-land reclamation than Minnesota. This administration intends to improve our standing dramatically.
Today we are witnessing the destruction of another magnificent resource--Lake Superior. For thousands of years the lake was pure. And in less than 20 years we befouled it. It will take 500 to 1,000 years before the asbestiform fibers settle out of the water.
It saddens me to think that 30 years ago we didn't heed the warning of one individual ~ now a Legislator, who spoke out in opposition
to granting a permit to Reserve Mining allowing them to dump taconite tailings into Lake Superior. At this time, 1 want to publicly recognize that individual, representative Willard Munger of Duluth.
And we still have not found a way to stop Reserve Mining from dumping into that lake and preserve the jobs of 3,000 Minnesota human, beings at the same time. We must do that and we will together during this Legislative session.
Lately we have started to do better. And we've been fortunate. We've had a second chance to turn environmental exploitation into environmental, social and economic efforts to develop these great resources. I'm proud of those efforts and I will continue to support them.
We are also facing the terrible effects of drought on our water resources. And they must be preserved and perpetuated.


The first step is to find out what we really have. We must finish the public water inventory of surface waters now underway. And we must start as soon as possible to make a comprehensive inventory of our underground water.
The record has improved in recent years. But most important our attitude is better. We are trying harder to keep what we have left.
We must also try much harder to preserve what we have left of our national energy resources. That means we must stop wasting energy.
Except for peat Minnesota has no natural energy resources at all.
Energy conservation must become a major state goa1 not because it is the proper thing to do, but because it's the only sane thing to duo Our quality of life depends on it.
We have some of the nation'ss pioneer energy conservation measures but they are not enough. This year I will ask the Legislature to approve the farthest-reaching and most comprehensive energy conservation program ever considered by any state.
It won't be an easy program to pass. It will affect a great many people. It will require some difficult changes for all of us. But there is no alternative--except disaster.
My proposals will include a state government energy conservation program to cut out energy use by 10 percent. It will require consideration of alternative energy in any new state buildings.


Conservation can do more than save energy. It can give us the time to develop alternative energy sources.
We must support plans to bring Alaska's oil and natural gas to Minnesota. We must also support the proposed coal use study of Minnesota's Environmental Quality Council.
And I pledge to you today that I will do everything I can to continue the Anderson Administration's effort to bring a new National Solar Energy Institute to Minnesota.
We have an opportunity to become a mode) state in energy conservation and research. I can't imagine a more important goal.
But whatever we do to conserve energy! we are still going to need more of the electrical power it provides.
Because of your good work, we now have state laws that regulate the siting of power plants or power lines in the state. But some of our citizens thing they are unfair.
You already have Governor Anderson's recommendation before you.
And I want to announce today that Speaker Martin Sabo and Majority Leader Nicholas Coleman, Senator Gerald Willet and Representative Willard Munger have agreed to hold joint hearings on power line sitings within the next two weeks. They will be held in the area affected by the UPA-CPA line. Lieutenant Governor Alec Olson will represent me at those meetings and will give the power line conflict priority attention.


We will need more electrical power in Minnesota. We must be sure that we get it the right way.
Our energy and environmental needs require a new commitment of government, industry and the people of Minnesota to form a partnership for the future.
In the long run, our high quality of life depends on our ability to keep a healthy environment, healthy people and a healthy economy.
To do that, we must also have a healthy relationship with the federal government in Washington.
That's why I have assigned Lieutenant Governor Alec Olson to improve state-federal cooperation and coordination.
Vice President Mondale comes from this state. We have two strong senators and real Minnesota leadership in the United States House of Representatives.
They can help us and I know they will, not only to bring more federal dollars to Minnesota, but also to help cities and counties and school districts keep doing a good job for our people.
We can speak for all Minnesota government, state and local, and that is what I'm asking Lieutenant Governor Alec Olson to do.
The state of Minnesota does a good job for its people. We have-identified and assisted those with special needs. We have developed many programs and improved many others. We have invested heavily in opportunity for our people.


We have tried to make state and local government work well and give our people more equal services through fair taxes and fair funding. We have also improved our management of state funds and state budgets. We have been able to. do our work and serve our people without increasing any major state taxes during the past two Legislative sessions.
I hope we will not increase taxes in this session either. We will have enough revenue to keep our state budget balanced for the next two years and that makes us more fortunate than many other states. But there will be no extra money.
The resources provided by our taxpayers are precious. They come from people who work hard for a living. We already ask more from. them than most states do.
It is time for us to enter a new era in Minnesota state government. The time is coming when Governors and Legislators will no longer be judged on the number of their new proposals or their success in passing them. Instead, the test will be our wisdom and skill in making present laws work well for our people.
There will continue to be a need for some new laws and for refinement of the laws we have.
But our highest priorities should be management, responsiveness, cooperation instead of competition--the best possible service at the lowest possible cost.
We must pay as much attention to the quality of our stewardship as we do to the nobility of our purpose. That is what our people want and that is what they deserve from us.


For my part, I do not intend to make promises that we cannot fulfill.
We already have excellent state government leadership, thanks to Governor Anderson, the LEAP Program and this Legislature.
Our financial stability has earned this state government a triple A credit rating, the highest there is.
Because of administrative and organizational reforms, we have better tools than ever before. Now, together, is the time to use those tools.
We do not need more state employees. We do need to get full value for every dollar we spend.
And all of us meet today to celebrate the Minnesota spirit-that people are the strength and purpose of government.
As I see it, I have three tasks before me: 1. To run the Executive Branch honestly, efficiently, openly and compassionately. 2. To cooperate with you, the Legislature, in making sound policy and carrying it out well. 3. Above all, to listen to and talk with, the people.
As I try to do that, my goal will be a government that works hard for people and not for self-preservation. My goal will be a government that responds more imaginatively to the needs and the rights of the people of Minnesota.


The number of women and minority citizens in positions of responsibility is insignificant compared with their contributions to society. I pledge to bring more minorities and women into major policy positions in state government.
I will also work for more participation and involvement of the people who give us their resources and our strengths. Many people have volunteered to help and I know that they can help. They have much to show us and we have much to show the nation by making good use of them. I am determined to do that.
I'm also determined to give individual Minnesota citizens the information and help they need from our state agencies.
This state has pioneered open meetings, but real openness means being willing and prepared to answer the questions of citizens with great respect and greater speed. It also means listening to complaints and suggestions and taking recommendations seriously.
The openness of government to the public is the key to responsive, compassionate and truly effective government.
I approach my new tasks with great enthusiasm for what has been accomplished, and great excitement for what still remains to be done.
I promise today to work untiringly with you to fulfill our Minnesota spirit. lIve worked in this building for a long time and know most of you well. My office and my staff will help you in any way we can.


But I also need your help. I ask for it and I welcome it. And we can all succeed if we work together and live by the words described in a plaque that was presented to me by a center for handicapped people. The plaque reads: None of us is as smart as all of us. 1I
We have been blessed by the land of this state. Our resources have given us productive farms and forests, mines,and other industries.
But our state has not been made great just because of those resources. It is our people who have made those resources productive farmers and forest managers, miners and factory workers, good business people, good legislators and good public officials.
The real resource of this successful society is our people and the Minnesota spirit they have produced.
Have a good session.
Thank you very much.

Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices, Members of the 73rd State Legislature, Constitutional Officers, Governors, distinguished friends and fellow Minnesotans:
Let me first say a word of thanks to Governor Quie and his administration for their excellent cooperation during our transition period. The Governor and his staff did everything possible to help us in this hectic period between election and inauguration. Thank you very much, Governor.
I want to welcome Senator Dave Durenberger to these Chamber. He has worked in the office of a past governor and is well aware that our economic recovery will depend on federal -- as well as state actions. We look forward to working with him in establishing a strong state and federal partnership.
***
As the 36th governor of Minnesota, I am today performing my constitutional duty by bringing you a report on the "State of the State."
The state of our state is not good. But we are not here to dwell on problems. Rather, we are here to outline the steps that are needed to find solutions. I have no slogans for this speech -- no new deal, fair deal or square deal. But for those who want a capsule comment on where we are headed, let me suggest that the central goal of our administration will be economic recovery, and the basic method for achieving that goal will be a partnership between government and the people it serves.

I believe that creation of jobs and expansion of employment rests on these broad principles --
We must nurture the startup and growth of small business as the key to the economic and social revitalization of Minnesota. The economic health of our farm economy is vital. We already have the human, financial, technological and natural resources to achieve this revitalization, but these resources are not being utilized to their utmost. The only practical way of tapping these resources is a genuine and broad-based public-private partnership that includes business, government, education, labor, agriculture, churches and all other segments of influence in our society. All of us must head in the same direction. We need more than a quick-fix. We need improved productivity in the workplace. We need quality in education, particularly in languages, math, science and computers. We need a long-range plan to visualize where Minnesota is headed 5, 10 and 20 years down the road. Ladies and gentlemen of the Legislature, that is where we will begin today.
***
Let me talk first about the role of partnership in the process of economic recovery. The economic recovery of Minnesota requires a concerted and cooperative effort. It is the duty of this administration

to propose new solutions to the Legislature. It is the duty of the Legislature to review those ideas, alter or replace them if appropriate, and to enact them into law. It is our duty together to implement these new ideas.
What I am saying is remindful of another inaugural message by Governor Harold Stassen in 1939, when Minnesota was beginning to slowly edge out of the Great Depression. He spoke of cooperation and mutual respect. The words he used then are just as useful now. I quote Governor Stassen:
"It will be my policy in this message, and throughout this session of the Legislature, to respect your prerogative, to recognize the division of powers between the branches of government under the Constitution, and to ask you, frankly, for your help in reaching the objectives of our administration, and in fulfilling the desires of the people."
I intend to keep my list of proposals to you relatively short. I want you to know in advance that we will be concentrating on four key areas: Economic development, energy, agriculture and assistance to the needy.
I urgently request from you a genuine, open debate on these and other public policy issues. Take my proposals and air them fully. Hone them and perfect them. But let all the people of Minnesota see them debated and acted upon.
***
We should also look to others in addition to ourselves for new ideas.
I have been very pleased with the organizations and individuals who have submitted recommendations on ways to initiate our economic recovery. Business groups, organized labor, nonprofit organizations and

higher education have all set forth useful ideas for state initiatives. I urge you to consider them carefully.
I want to call your attention to the work of an individual seated here today. Last year Representative John Brandl published his proposal on "A Fiscal Agenda for Minnesota." He argued for substantial reform in the manner by which public services are delivered and the method used to finance them.
In his words, "The way out of our fiscal swamp is not a mere compromise between spending and taxing, but a bold revamping of the ways we spend and tax."
Representative Brandl's main points are: 1. We must protect those who are needy with basic education,
basic income and basic medical care. 2. We should provide money rather than services to the needy.
Government itself need not produce services if people have money to procure them elsewhere. 3. Institutionalized people should be returned to a normal environment whenever and wherever possible. 4. We should foster self-help rather than dependence on government. 5. We can charge people for public service. If citizens have the money to pay, then charging the cost of a service is an inducement to provide those services economically, and to provide only those services for which people are willing to pay. 6. Service providers, including those in government, should be held accountable.

Each of us could argue the merits of these ideas. But the point is, they are bold new directions. I am convinced that only bold new directions can solve our fiscal crisis, and I urge the Legislature to consider Representative Brandl's proposals as a starting point for this year's deliberations.
***
I have initiated the following steps to provide additional ideas on how best to work toward recovery:
First, within a few days we will be inviting all the former governors of Minnesota to a meeting at the Governor's residence. Each of these individuals is a special person, elected by Minnesotans to meet the particular needs of a particular time. Each has insights on what needs to be done and what can be done.
Second, I plan to establish a regular schedule of breakfast meetings with leaders of agriculture, business, education and labor. Together with government and the people of Minnesota, they will make our new partnership.
Third, last week I announced the appointment of Blue-Ribbon Economic Recovery Commissions in ten key growth sectors of the Minnesota economy. These groups will advise our administration on high technology, medical technology, tourism, agri-processing, wood products, minerals, film and graphic arts, international trade, banking and investment, and construction. I have asked these groups to bring me a fast track report by February 15 on how government can assist these key industries to grow and prosper.

Another special commission will make recommendations on what to do about our state planning functions. More than ever we need the capability to envision the Minnesota of the future.
Fourth, I have asked my staff and the commissioner of Finance to initiate a thorough review of the state budget. The recent special session of the Legislature forced us to delay our final budget planning by about three weeks, and I have asked your permission to submit my budget message on February 15.
***
Government will play a key role in the economic recovery partnership. Over the last three years we have asked state agencies,schools, and local government to absorb a substantial amount of budget cuts.
I would like to be able to tell you that the cutting is over, but I cannot. However, any additional reductions we make must be extremely selective.
We must try to consolidate governmental offices, agencies and institutions. We must also seek new options for providing public services.
State government reorganization is one way to make the delivery of services more efficient and cost-effective. Right now more than 30 agency heads report directly to me. Any good management plan would cut that number by one-half.
To start with, we are recommending a reorganization of the Commerce Department and a transfer of the Consumer Services function to the Office of the Attorney General. In addition, we are considering various options for the departments of Health, Public Welfare and Energy,

Planning and Development. I am also committed"to substantially reducing the number of direct gubernatorial appointments to boards and commissions.
I respectfully request that constitutional offices and the Judicial and Legislative branches undergo the same self-evaluation now underway in the Executive Branch. With respect to the Legislature, I urge you to consider whether 201 individuals are necessary to represent the people of Minnesota. I suggest you consider reducing the size of the Legislature, with the reduction to become effective after the 1990 census.
***
This process of self-evaluation cannot be limited to state government. Schools, cities, counties and towns must accelerate their efforts to streamline their operations.
In my Inaugural Address on Monday, I said I was deeply concerned that past budget cuts in education have fallen far too hard on classroom teachers and not hard enough on the administration of schools. I am concerned that the teaching of languages, math and science is slipping. Minnesota students must be in the forefront of computer knowledge both for their own benefit and for the benefit of Minnesota-based industries, which will need them as workers.
The lack of computer education will intensify the divisions between the haves and have-nots in our society. We cannot allow this to happen.

I intend to speak out repeatedly on the subject of education and repeat my warning that we cannot retreat to a narrow teaching of the three Rs in an age of computers and lasers. We cannot afford to send our students into ~ high tech society with ~ low tech education.
***
How we raise money to finance government also will affect our recovery. It is time to initiate a major reexamination of how we finance the operation of government. As you know so well, for the past three years we have cut budgets and raised taxes repeatedly, and we have been forced into the use of shifts. That must stop.
As Governor, I never used or threatened vetoes. My philosophy is to have an early warning system, letting legislative sponsors know that changes in certain bills would be urged. That system has worked well, and I believe I have a good working relationship with the Legislature.
But let me say here that I will use the veto, if necessary, to avoid further dependence on shifts as a way of balancing the state budget.
Let me say a few words about my philosophy on revenue raising. I will save the details for my February 15 Budget Message, but I want you to know that I will be seeking tax reforms leading to a system that is stable, equitable, and simple.
To help us assure a stable system, we must appropriate a reasonable budget reserve. We will be using conservative estimates in our budget projections. But even so, we must have a budget cushion large enough to protect against unanticipated economic downturns. I will include a specific proposal for a reserve in my Budget Message.

Over two-thirds of what now is called "state spending" does not go for what usually is thought to be "state government." Seventy cents of every dollar spent by the state is returned to schools, local governments or directly to individuals in the form of "transfer payments." It is money collected by the state but channeled directly back to citizens and their cities, counties, towns and schools.
In recent years we have run into trouble because we have promised more in these transfer payments than we have been able to deliver. Local governments have justifiably complained; their budget planning has suffered as a result.
In February I will be proposing to you a system whereby schools and local governments will be asked to share the risk of state revenue collections. If the state revenues fall below our conservative projections, then the governmental recipients of these aid payments should be expected to bear a proportionate reduction in payments.
Without this flexible aid formula for schools and local government, and without a budget reserve, the only alternative is a series of special legislative sessions. No one benefits from special sessions; I am committed to avoiding them.
***
As you know, our credit rating has suffered as we have turned increasingly to short-term borrowing because of cash flow problems. Clearly, that must end. We must join in taking all necessary steps to restore our credit rating to Triple-A and MIG-I.
***

Let me sum up my thoughts on fiscal matters. We must do more than merely cut budgets or raise taxes. We must reexamine both the size and nature of government expenditures. All levels of government must participate in this process, and all levels must share in the risk of economic down cycles. The state can no longer be looked to as the guarantor of aid levels to schools and cities.
***
Reducing the cost of government,' and making government more efficient, will help our economic recovery. But government can also play a positive role; it can be the source of new initiatives and a prime mover in our new partnership.
An example of an opportunity for a positive role for government is reducing the cost of workers' compensation insurance. I am asking you to deal with this issue - and to solve it - in the 1983 session. To help in this effort, we can refer to various studies recently completed.
I am convinced that we can reduce the cost of workers' compensation insurance to the employers of the state without impairing benefits for injured workers. ~By making the system more efficient and more equitable, and building in the proper incentives for both workers and employers, we can remove this barrier to economic recovery.
***
I will soon be sending you a number of additional new initiatives designed to help put Minnesotans back to work and to get our economy moving again. I call my philosophy for these new initiatives "investment budgeting." By that I mean we must concentrate our limited resources in

those sectors of the economy where state assistance can do the most good and where one dollar of state investment will yield many dollars in increased economic activity.
Tourism is an excellent example. I have made a commitment to increase our tourism budget to $6.2 million, about four times its present size. If past patterns hold true, that amount will produce over $100 million in new revenues for Minnesota businesses and workers.
I have asked Marlene Johnson, our new Lieutenant Governor, to spearhead this tourism initiative. I cannot tell you how proud I am to have Marlene. - the first woman Lieutenant Governor in the history of Minnesota - as a partner on our team.
We have other investment opportunities in the state, and I will give you more ideas on those in several weeks.
To fund these investments, we could use direct appropriations, sale of bonds, prudent use of invested funds; we could provide direct loans to businesses, loan guarantees, equity investments or participate in regional venture capital programs.
We'll be looking at dollar-stretching ideas -- leveraging state money to the maximum. We will look for prudent investments in ways that create opportunity and stimulate other investments. On January 24, I will deliver, to you, the investment budget with detailed recommendations.
***
We will not experience a full economic recovery until the depression on our farms has ended. Agriculture and related businesses are the backbone of the Minnesota economy. The current tragedy on our farms affects all of us, rural and city residents alike.

We have taken steps to resolve this problem, and I ask your help in searching for others.
To date, we have appointed a special trade representative for agriculture, we issued an Executive Order on the use of gasohol in state-owned vehicles, we have begun research on the full extent of farm mortgage foreclosures, and we are working with governors in eight nearby states on a minimum pricing bill.
***
Our economic recovery is also dependent on our ability to increase energy conservation programs and to develop alternative energy sources. Our climate and our lack of traditional fossil fuels pose a significant barrier to economic growth.
We must do more to weatherize our public buildings, residences and businesses. We must develop sources of alternative energy like peat, biomass, hydro, solar and wood residues. And we must provide incentives for the expansion of district heating systems.
Because energy is so important to our economic recovery, I will be delivering a separate message to the Legislature on that topic within several weeks.
***
Let me discuss our most pressing and most immediate need providing food, shelter and clothing for those Minnesotans who are out of work, and who have no other sources of support.

For too many Minnesotans, these are truly desperate times. While we speak of economic recovery in the future, they cry out for food and shelter now. Our churches, foundations, businesses, labor unions and individuals are struggling to meet the needs, but more must be done.
As Governor, I am in a unique position to bring together all of our state's major institutions to concentrate on this problem. Already I have instructed our state agencies to evaluate possible initiatives. We are looking into the possibility of using National Guard armories and other state facilities as possible shelters for the homeless this winter.
Even with our best efforts, government needs help to solve this pervasive problem. I am pleased at recent initiatives by the private sector. Within the past week, the McKnight Foundation, in partnership with the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, announced a major grant program that will put over 600 Minnesotans to work in the private sector. I extend my deep appreciation to the Foundation and to the mayors of the cities who worked so hard to put that program together.
We Minnesotans who have a job, or some source of income, must do our part to help alleviate the suffering of others. Various communities in the state have begun volunteer programs to help meet the food, clothing and shelter needs of the unemployed. We can learn from these examples.
I am asking every mayor and county commissioner to consider how their community can institute a volunteer program and to work with us in state government and the private sector.
To those of you without jobs, this is my message: I know of your problems; I have been through similar experiences before. Do not give up hope.
I am making a personal and heartfelt commitment to do what I can to help.

***
Two years ago the Legislature limited eligibility for persons on general assistance. Able-bodied persons with marketable skills were denied benefits. At the time this was done, the economy was not in the condition we find it today.
Those who are able and willing to work are having extreme difficulty in finding a job. The Pot1ach Corporation had 130 job openings for a new wood products plant opening March 1st in Cook, Minnesota. They have been accepting applications for two weeks and already had over 8,000 inquiries.
We cannot continue to penalize those persons who are suffering as a result of bad economic conditions. Eligibility for general assistance must be expanded or we must find other ways to help those who have no other sources of assistance available to them.
In the coming weeks I want to harness the compassion, the energy and the ideas of all Minnesotans into the greatest self-help operation this state has ever seen. We are a strong people, and we are a caring people. And we are one people. Together we can get over this recession and plant the seeds for a strong economic future.
***
Much of what I have talked about today has emphasized the need for a partnership between the public and private sectors in Minnesota. I want to stress that point one more time. Churches and nonprofit organizations alone cannot feed the hungry or house the homeless. Business and labor alone cannot turn the economy around. Government alone cannot

restore our crumbling infrastructure. It takes a concerted effort - an effort based on mutual trust and a willingness to compromise.

today.

***
Let me sum up the eight major points I want to leave with you
1. The goal of our administration will be the economic recovery of Minnesota, and to achieve this goal we will rely on a strong partnership between government and the people it serves.
2. We must continue to reduce the cost of government by reevaluating how and why government taxes us and what it does with those tax revenues; we must look to government reorganization and consolidation as another way to reduce cost.
3. We must reform our tax system to make it more stable, more equitable and more simple.
4. We must better manage our state's finances: I will veto any further shifts, we will insist on a reasonable budget reserve, we will use conservative budget estimates, and we will reduce, to the extent possible, our reliance on short-term borrowing.
5. We will reevaluate the fiscal relationships between the state and our schools and local governments; the state can no longer be the guarantor of local finances.
6. We must maintain a forward-looking education system; we cannot afford to send our students into a high tech society with a low tech education.


7. We will do everything possible to create favorable opportunities for business growth in the state; we will recommend "investment budgeting" and we will strive hard for the passage of workers' compensation insurance reform.
8. And finally, we must not forget our duty to those Minnesotans who are out of work and without any sources of support.
I will close with these thoughts - we face a real crisis in the life of our state, because of the number of people out of work, and the problems of state revenues. Yet, I harbor the strong belief that in adversity people can be at their best.
This becomes clear when blizzards strike, like the one of last week. People did not despair, they pitched in and helped each other, and there was a bond that normally does not exist when times are good.
I hope that can happen, for however many months or years it takes, to pull us out of the economic "blizzard" we. are now experiencing.
We have seen this cooperative spirit before. It has been evident in bad times, and we recovered.
Columnist Walter Lippman once put it this way: "You took the good things for granted. Now you must earn them again. It is written: 'For every right that you cherish, you have a duty which you must fulfill. For every hope that you entertain, you have a task you must perform. For every good that you wish could happen .. You will have to sacrifice your comfort and ease. There is nothing for nothing any longer.'"
We have a lot to do. I need your help. Now let's get going! Thank you.

Mr. Speaker, mr. President, mr. Chief justice, members of the court, members of the legislature, constitutional officers, former governors and fellow Minnesotans.
It is my duty under the constitution to again report to you on the "state of the state." i want to share with you my perspective of where we have been . My sense of where we are and my vision of where we can go.
I am pleased to say that we can look back on a year of hard work and accomplishment.
The state of our state is much improved today from a year ago.
And i can also say that we can now look ahead with a sense of optimism, of confidence, that was not possible a year ago.
As a result, we can take hold of our destiny once again.
We can restore Minnesota to its place of greatness among our states.
We can shape a Minnesota that works not only for the rest of 1980s but also for the 1990s and beyond.
 


First, let's look back to one year ago.
We were reeling from one special legislative session to another. There were five special legislative sessions in one year prompted by our recurring budget crisis.
You in the legislature were forced to raise taxes and cut service .
We were desperately trying to prevent bankruptcy. One business
columnist was predicting that the state would be bankrupt by november i, 1983.
We were confronted by a massive financial deficit.
Our triple-a credit rating was gone.
Unemployment had gone beyond 10 percent.
The threat of farm foreclosures was running high, and food shelves were running low.
Minnesota - the state that worked - was sputtering.
Our people had lost confidence in their state government.
It was not a happy time for Minnesota.


We took office with no easy slogans, no quick fixes, but we did make one pledge: To make state government work again and to help put Minnesotans back to work, that promise has been kept,
 
when we came into office one year ago, i laid out two immediate goals for Minnesota:
Restore fiscal stability and put our people back to work, i am happy to report that we are doing well on both fronts, our budget is balanced and we paid off more than 500 million dollars in old bills, we are starting to get our good credit ratings back and there is money in the bank,
 


in place of a massive deficit, we have a solid budget reserve.

Minnesota, i'm proud to say, appears to be in the healthiest financial shape of any state in this country.

And i intend to keep it that way.

 

 

This past year in state government can be summed up in three words: Stability, credibility and dependability.

The credit for this impressive turnaround must be shared with the people of Minnesota, and with you, the members of the legislature.

It was your willingness to make the tough decisions last spring that put our fiscal house in order.

It was a team effort, and it worked.

Minnesota's economic recovery is strong, and our people are going back to work.

82,000 more Minnesotans are working today than one year ago.


Our unemployment rate has dropped from 10.4 percent last January to 6.8
percent. That's below the national average.
The job-creating programs, which you approved last session, are working well.
We have put more than 7,200 people to work on the emergency jobs
program.
The confidence of Minnesota business leaders was badly shaken by the fiscal nightmares of the past.
But our determination to provide fiscal stability and our determination to make government work has given renewed confidence to decision-makers in the business world.
 
They now see a state that balances its books that meets problems head on that insists on tough fiscal management.
And they have an administration that listens that cares . And keeps its promises.
 


One of the promises i made a year ago was to nurture a new era of cooperation in Minnesota involving labor, business, education, agriculture and government. I called it a new "partnership."
but lately i have been referring to it as our  Minnesota family" -made up of our diverse ethnic and economic groups -- a family whose members help each other through the tough times.
That idea -- whether you call it partnership or family -- is vital to the long-range economic health of our state.
We must build bridges -- not dig chasms -- between the segments of our society.
One of my first actions as governor was to appoint economic recovery commissions, bi-partisan in membership and chaired by some of Minnesota's more prominent citizens.
These volunteer commissions worked rapidly to produce recommendations . I accepted their recommendations and you enacted many of them into law.
The results have been impressive. From wood products to tourism to technology, we are seeing the benefits of this new spirit of cooperation.


Let me cite some of year's headlines:
Ford motor company announced a 250 million dollar expansions in st. Paul, one of the largest industrial expansions anywhere in the country.
Apache corporation decided to stay in Minnesota and expand.
IBM, one of our major employers, outlined a long-term growth program.
Eta systems selected st. Paul as its headquarters, assuring that Minnesota will be the super-computer of the world.
Louisiana pacific picked Minnesota over several other states for a new wood products plant.
Prudential announced plans to move a major division to Minneapolis,
adding some 1300 jobs.
H.B. Fuller company dedicated a 12 million dollar research and development center in vadnais heights .
And honeywell announced phase one of a three-part 43 million dollar
building expansion.
Whether it's sanborn manufacturing expanding in springfield .


I.D.A. Corporation growing in moorhead or the biosorb company moving from north dakota to Minnesota . The story is the same, wherever i go: Minnesota workers are among the most productive in the country. Let me give you a few more examples, watlow electric company has plants in illinois, iowa and west germany. They could have expanded in any of those places. Bur they chose to add hundreds of jobs in winona because of the quality of the workforce. Executives of ford motor company told me the same thing , so did thin film technologies of north mankato . And so did star technologies when they opened a research facility in brooklyn park.
 There are just a few examples, but they tell an important story: Minnesota has turned the corner and is on the move.


We have made a big start toward the major long-range goal of this administration:
To make Minnesota the best place to live work play . And .. The best place to do business.
 
But we cannot stop here. Our agenda remains full. And it will require more bridge-building . More pulling together as a Minnesota family.
Our first and foremost objective is to make Minnesota competitive with the rest of the country.
Some of our state taxes are too high and must be reduced. Our citizens are willing to pay for quality service, but they are paying too much today.
That's why my top priority for the 1984 legislative session is to cut taxes. I am proposing five immediate tax changes.
First, repeal of the 10 percent income surtax on july 1st. This will
put 230 million dollars into the pockets of Minnesota taxpayers over the
next 18 months.


Second, transfer of the motor vehicle excise tax into the highway construction fund, retroactive to last july 1st. This will pump an
additional 93 million dollars into highway construction and transit,
improving our transportation systems and putting people to work. It keeps a promise already made.
Third, repeal of the unitary tax on corporations, helping Minnesota firms in the world marketplace.
Fourth, adoption of several incentives to encourage our businesses to enter world markets. This will cost us little, but will send an important signal.
Fifth, repeal of the state's share of the estate tax. Easing the burden on our senior citizens, and encouraging our retired citizens to stay in Minnesota.
These changes are necessary and urgent to keep our economic momentum.
These reductions will set the steps for further and more comprehensive tax reform recommendations from the latimer tax study commission, which i appointed last year.


This bi-partisan commission will conduct a top-to-bottom review of our
tax structure, and make recommendations to the 1985 legislature. It will be the most thorough analysis of tax policy in 30 years, and it will position
Minnesota for economic leadership for generations to come.
Beyond these immediate tax-reducing proposals, my legislative program will be brief and to the point.
The most important objective will be to hold spending to an absolute minimum.
We have worked hard to put Minnesota back on its feet financially .
As part of our effort to make Minnesota a competitive leader in this country, we must continually re-examine our structure. We must prune reorganize and streamline. Our goal must always be to eliminate red tape and fat.
However, i must also point out that the number of non-faculty employees
on the state payroll has declined over the past 10 years. State employees
are doing a good job -- anyone who drives on clear highways within hours after a blizzard can testify to that.


As a means of prompting an on-going review of state government, i am
recommending that reforms be made in all three branches -- executive, legislative and judicial.
First, a citizen commission will report soon on some options relating to constitutional offices. Several elected officials have proposed such a review, and i believe the time is right for a constitutional amendment to be considered.
Second, i again strongly recommend that the legislature make a serious attempt to agree on a reduction in size. While i am not firmly committed to
a particular number, a house of 100 members and a senate of 50 seems to make
sense. If this change can be enacted, it should be written to take effect
for the 1992 elections, following the next census.
Third, a commission created by this legislature has recommended
unification of our county and district courts. I have appointed all 12
members of our new court of appeals, and that court has plunged into its work. It is time to have a court system of three levels -- no more.


These immediate actions:

Tax reduction, spending restraint, and reducing the size of government
will send a clear signal that Minnesota can respond positively and
aggressively to the needs of the 1980s and prepare itself for the 1990s.

 

 

One of the most difficult -- yet important -- problems you will face this session is revision of our unemployment compensation program.

In the past, we chose to borrow from the federal government rather than adopt a pay-as-you-go system. That is another overdue bill which must be paid.

Yet, business -- particularly small business -- needs relief. But we
cannot turn our backs on the unemployed worker who wants to work but cannot find a job.


A special commission with representation from both labor and management
is hard at work on this issue, and is making progress. This issue is too important to the workers and businesses of this state to become a political football. Here again, let us think of building bridges -- let us work together to find a permanent solution.
This issue -- and many of the issues we will deal with -- affect the small businesses of Minnesota. Most of them don't have public relations firms, and don't make flashy announcements when they open or expand. But
they provide 80 percent of the new jobs in Minnesota each year -- and their
voice must be heard.
 
This session of the legislature should be short and limited in scope.
You have my pledge of support to complete the session in six or seven weeks.
As always, i am always available to meet with members of the
legislature to facilitate the work of the 1984 session.
 
Here in Minnesota, i see 1984 as a turning point. We are poised to
move in new directions.


Thanks to the foresight of our leaders and the sacrifice of our citizens we have a fine education system 
Minnesota is known throughout the world for high technology 
we hold a pre-eminent position in medicine and health carel medical technology and tele-communications 
few other states can claim a stronger agricultural base, , ,
our record of nurturing small businesses is a strong one ,
and no other state has taken better care of its infrastructure i environment and quality of life.
 
So it's clear that the ingredients are all there for Minnesota to lead and profit from the economic revolution that's sweeping america.
We must inventory our strengths and capitalize on them , ,
we must identify our weaknesses and correct them 
and above all we must have the courage and foresight to turn from the past and embrace the future, we cannot afford the luxury of looking only to
next month or next year, we must anticipate and plan for 1990 and beyond,


in the next few weeks, 11 members of my administration will be reporting in detail on long-range plans for Minnesota. I want these speeches and messages to be viewed as follow-ups to this "state of the state" message.
They will cover education, the environment, regulation and de-regulation and a variety of other subjects. I hope you will find this system a useful departure from the past.
In the few minutes remaining i would like to underscore some of the highlights . .
Pivotal to our future is the overhaul and modernization of our tax structure -- and the streamlining of government -- to give Minnesota the competitive edge in this country. We have taken steps to reduce the cost of workers compensation and we will act to reduce other costs of doing business.
Minnesota will be a state that means business.
 
Education is the flagship of our future


we must view education in global terms . With particular emphasis on mathematics, science, languages and technology.
We must encourage the work of our gifted and talented young people.
And, we must support our colleges and universities in their efforts to expand partnerships with business and industry.
This demands investments in education priorities at all levels.
Many commissions -- both in government and in the private sector -- are studying our educational system. This is good.
We must always look to retaining traditional values in education, but we cannot be afraid to discard old methods when new ones are better.
We must look to new generations of computers and other technologies, but we also must look to new emphasis on arts, music and foreign languages in our schools.
We must soften the hard edges of technology with the songs, poetry and literature of the ages.


Nothing will enhance the future strength of this state more than energy self-sufficiency -- a priority that i have repeatedly stressed for this
administration. We are currently paying over 7 billion dollars a year for our energy needs. And more than half of this 7 billion dollars is leaving
our state to enrich other parts of the world.
That's why we must develop our state's own energy resources. We must keep our energy dollars . And the jobs they provide . At home in Minnesota.
 
Minnesota is now positioned to move aggressively into international marketing.
Many of the great multi-national corporations are headquartered here . .
We have a first-class trade office . .
And the development of the world trade center will make Minnesota the hub of international activity in the midwest.
To solidify our leadership position, i would like to see a graduate school of international business added to one of our colleges or universities.
 


One of the great tragedies of our time is that the ability of american farmers to produce is turned into surpluses . Rather than food for the hungry.
Despite modest increases in grain prices, we still have hard times -perhaps even a depression -- in our farm economy.
That is not something to be shunted aside, because agriculture accounts for 40 percent of Minnesota's economy.
Our goal is to work with farm leaders and the agri-processing industry
to open new markets in 1984. We can add value to farm products by
processing them in Minnesota.
We need better promotion -- Minnesota potatoes need not take a back seat to those from idaho. Minnesota cheese matches that made in wisconsin. Our apples are as tasty as those grown in washington.
Our agriculture department has begun a  Minnesota grown" promotion effort, and i endorse it fully.
 
No state has done a better job of protecting its environment and that effort was recognized a few weeks ago.


A four-year study by the conservation foundation ranked Minnesota first among the 50 states in efforts to protect the environment. That's a ranking we don't want to lose.
Just as important -- the study found that a state does not have to weaken its environmental regulations to attract jobs and industry.
That vigilance will continue.
We can get rid of mountains of old tires, old railroad ties, auto junkyards, solid waste dumps -- and anything else that is a blight on our environment.
We will scrub Minnesota clean.
We must launch a major program to upgrade sewage treatment plants throughout Minnesota. Along with protecting our waters, a strong wastewater treatment system is necessary for industrial expansion.
One of the follow-up messages will deal with our efforts to combat acid rain, Minnesota should be a leader in this effort. We recognized the problem early, and we brought it to national attention.
I intend to make acid rain a major and continuing topic in the national governors' association.
 


Thanks to your courageous votes last session, we have already begun the long process of rebuilding and repairing Minnesota's critical road, highway and bridge network.
Even while that is underway, we should develop a light rail transit system in the metropolitan area to remove some traffic from our increasingly crowded streets and freeways.
 
Minnesota stands to gain more from tourism than most states . .
And thanks to actions of this legislature, we now have a greatly expanded promotion program underway. Inquiries to our tourism office are up by more than 25 percent.
1983 was a good year for our resort and hospitality industry, and 1984 should be even better.
Let me interject at this point a suggestion that we deal with several gaming issues this year -- and put them behind us. Questions of a lottery, greyhound racing and expanded bingo are public policy issues that deserve open, public debate. But they need not consume our interest for year after year.
 


Sports and the arts are not only good for the body and spirit, , , they are good for the state's economy.
We must do more to build private and public support for the arts , .
And we are going all-out to promote a successful, comprehensive sports program with the best major league and college teams in the country. Minnesota deserves the best.
I plan to appoint another citizens commission to study how we may better nurture the arts in Minnesota.
Our music, art and literature can link us to foreign lands.
As i told the Minnesota education association last winter, we live in a world with a multiplicity of languages, many religions and different forms of government. Art is the common denominator, the universal language.
 
In this time of changing priorities and austere budgets . .
We should not, and we shall not, ..
Abandon our commitment to those who need help the most . ,


the handicapped . The elderly .. The poor and the unemployed minorities who are victims of discrimination and women who are underpaid solely because they are women.
Minnesota's compassion for those in need will be maintained.
 
Minnesota's future will be greatly enhanced by our ability to forge strong working relationships with other states, particularly those in the midwest.
For that reason, i have accepted assignments as chairman of the midwest governors' conference, and as a member of the executive committee of the national governors' association.
Tomorrow we open the second session of the Minnesota-wisconsin dialogue to discuss joint efforts in pollution control, acid rain, international trade, education and resource development.
We will soon undertake similar discussions with south dakota and iowa.
And later this week, we host a meeting of the northeastern and midwestern states on the subject of energy.
 


In closing, i want to thank the legislature and the people of Minnesota for helping to turn the state around and put it firmly on course.
Minnesota is on the move . .
Strategically poised in the leadership position as the nation's economic transformation accelerates.
Our goal is to make this state the best place in the country to live and work and play and do business.
We have made great progress, but we have much more work ahead.
There are far too many Minnesotans who want a job and cannot find one.
Our tax burden is too high and must be reduced.
Our educational system, the heart of our future, must be improved.
We must make government work more efficiently and at lower cost for the benefit of our citizens.


He face some very important challenges for 1984. But i want us to look
even farther ahead than that. As i learned during my recent years in
business, you can't judge results in a few months or even a year. We have
to look to the kind of Minnesota we want for the rest of the 1980s and for
the decades which lie beyond. This is my goal:
To position Minnesota for greatness in a rapidly changing world. It is why i have placed much emphasis on my own personal travel and upon international trade.
I see it as the future, and we must capitalize on that future.
I am convinced that Minnesota can become one of the great centers of culture and commerce, of education and opportunity, of sports and recreation . A mecca where citizens from all backgrounds and all pursuits can live and work effectively together . Beacon of success and opportunity for the nation and the world.
This is a great challenge and a worthy goal.
I invite you to join with me in striving toward it.
Thank you.
Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, Mr. Chief Justice, members of the court, constitutional officers, members of the Legislature and my fellow Minnesotans.
Two years ago I began this address by stating that the central goal of this administration would be job creation and economic recovery, achieved through a partnership between the public and private sectors.
I am pleased to report to you that we have made giant strides toward this goal. The state of the state is greatly improved and getting better.
Two years ago Minnesota's unemployment rate stood at an all-time high.
216,000 of our people were out of work.
The Legislature had staggered through six special sessions, raising taxes, shifting spending and cutting services.
Minnesota's valued triple-A credit rating had been lost, and another deficit was looming on the horizon.
Our state faced the most severe financial crisis in its history.
 
In contrast today...

***

There are more than 170,000 additional Minnesotans employed.

In fact, there are 57,800 more people working now than ever before in the history of our state. For the year ending in October, Minnesota ranked second nationally in total employment gains.

Our state's bank account is in the black instead of the
red . . .

We are re-gaining our top credit ratings

We have a surplus in place of a deficit

And this month we shall payoff our last outstanding loan.

The turn-around has been one of the most dramatic and impressive in the nation.

***
In the past two years, we joined together a family unified by stress and we found our way.

 
We've helped each other we've reached out with

compassion to those in need

and we've restored

confidence and pride in our great state.

To each of you who helped during these difficult days thank you from the bottom of my heart.

I am grateful for your assistance, I am proud of your effort, and I am honored to be your Governor.

Special thanks go to you, the members of the legislature, for helping us make the difficult but necessary decisions.

New leaders have been chosen for this session of the Legislature, and I look forward to working with you.

For the first time in our state's history, a woman

Connie Levi

is the majority leader of the House of

Representatives in Minnesota. I congratulate you, Connie,

and I wish you well.

***
Now we turn our attention to the future, determined to build Minnesota to a position of strength in 1985 and the years ahead.

 
The challenge for the 1980s and 90s is to achieve vigorous, sustainable economic growth in rapidly changing times.
And I'm convinced that the state which will lead the nation is the one that best develops and harnesses the talents, energies and ingenuity of its people.
Minnesota has a natural advantage with well-educated, productive people. We must capitalize on our strengths.
The key to Minnesota's success lies in our ability to adapt this state to a nation and world of profound change. We must embrace change, and shape it, to meet tomorrow on our terms.
If we prepare for change. Minnesota will do well. Minnesota will do well because knowledge will be the steel of this post-industrial economy. Minnesota has the potential to become the number one brainpower state in the nation.
And believe me, we will be the brainpower state in the nation.
 
The path to permanent prosperity in Minnesota will require bold leadership and courageous legislative action to make our state more productive and competitive.

We must move decisively on four major fronts.

First we must reduce personal income taxes and simplify our tax forms.

Second we must control spending and guarantee fiscal stability.

Third we must strengthen our educational system.

Fourth we must accelerate our efforts in economic development and international trade.

All of these actions are aimed at one main strategy;

To create jobs quality jobs Minnesotans, now and in the future.

for all

***
Our first priority our first action must be a major reduction in personal income taxes.

 
My plan will save Minnesotans 604 million dollars, and will drop our maximum tax rate from sixteen percent to nine-point-nine percent.
For a family of four with one wage earner making 15,000 dollars a year Minnesota now ranks number one among all 50 states.
This tax cut will drop us to number 18 in that category. That makes me very happy I'm sure it does you too.
And for the first time in many years, Minnesota will no longer rank number one in any personal income tax category.
Were it not for the severe economic hardship in parts of Minnesota, we could make significantly larger tax reductions. However, we will not turn our backs on the thousands of Minnesotans who desperately need our help.
***
Along with this major tax cut, we must drastically simplify our tax forms.
I don't have to remind you what a hassle it is each year to fill out this tax form.
 
It's three pages long contains 32 pages of instructions and requires you to fill in over 100 spaces. It's a taxpayer's nightmare to say the least.
Under our plan you will have a simple one-page form.
It will haver only 16 lines, and it should take most of us less than 15 minutes to complete the form.
Minnesotans want, need and deserve tax reduction and simplification.
So I am appealing to the legislature to to make this tax reduction retroactive to January first of this year.
***
Our second major priority is spending control and fiscal stability. Stability means a strong state savings account, a budget reserve, a rainy day fund.
It goes by many names, but it means one thing -- an insurance policy against bad times, a guarantee that Minnesota will never again go through the financial chaos of a few years ago.
 
The reserve should be increased to 500 million dollars. I have a surprise for you. We have the money in the bank already. Just don't spend it.
An adequate reserve means we can pay our bills, make payments to local governments on time, and regain our triple-A credit rating.
Having a budgeted reserve is good, sound business practice and I am determined to get it enacted.
****
A strong budget reserve must be coupled with controls on state spending. Our budget team, under the direction of Finance Commissioner Donhowe, has spent nearly six months analyzing every conceivable way to cut the growth of government spending.
Thanks to their work, the budget which I will submit holds average spending increases to less than six percent a year, the smallest percentage increase in state spending in 20 years.
I can assure you that this budget contains only the most essential elements to provide quality services to our people.
 
I am determined to give Minnesota a national reputation for excellent fiscal management. My department heads will be judged by their ability to reduce spending and streamline state government. Our over-riding objective shall be to deliver quality services to the people of Minnesota as efficiently as possible.

We have proven that government can be lean without being mean.

It is my hope that by the time I leave the Office of

Governor, our state will be run with such efficiency

and such foresight

 that stockholders throughout the

United States will ask "Why can't business be run like

government in Minnesota."

On this issue, the federal government should take lessons from Minnesota.

Had Washington operated like Minnesota for the past two years, the federal government might be operating in the black instead of the red.

Unfortunately Washington doesn't have the discipline or ability to control spending.

 
The federal deficit is retarding the economic vitality of this country, and it must be brought under control.
I am announcing my support of a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced federal budget.
This is a dramatic step, but it must be taken.
Minnesota and other states are required to balance their budgets and I ask you, why not the federal government?
****
Positioning Minnesota for a dynamic future also requires investment. Investment to stimulate growth and create jobs investment in economic development and international trade.
There's a line from the broadway play liThe Music Man" about a traveling salesman. "You've got to know the territory."
Our territory in 1985 and beyond will be the world -- not just Minnesota, not just the Midwest, not just America -- but the world.
If you are a teacher you will be teaching more about other countries.
 
If you are a business person you will be learning more about exporting.

If you are a worker you will be looking at how your counterpart in another country does the job.

If you are a parent you will see your children

traveling more, 

learning more languages and

working in different parts of the world.

You will see that your children have opportunities which you and your parents never dreamed were possible.

Our state government must move forward with the rest of the world.

We must know the territory.

Where would the Japanese be today if they had stayed home?

Or more importantly, where would our steel industry be today if American steel executives -- rather than remaining complacent -- had decided to get to know the territory and make the world their marketplace?

We, not the Japanese, should be controlling the world steel markets.

 
Japan is not rich in natural resources. It imports

99 percent of its iron ore. 80 percent of its coal

 99 percent of its oil

 60 percent of its timber

and about one third of its food.

Yet, each year it records trade surpluses in the billions of dollars.

Japan is a world leader in consumer electronics, watches, motorcycles, cameras, automobiles and steel production.

Japan has succeeded because it strived in every way to become competitive. It developed and utilized technology. and then it headed around the world to sell its products and make investments.

We in Minnesota are following Japan's example. opening a bigger market for Minnesota's products, services and technologies.

It makes sense for us to do this because, Foreign trade is the wave of the future, and Minnesota must be ahead of the rest of the country. We must prepare now for the time when the value of the dollar is more realistic, and American products will once again be competitive in world markets.

 
International trade means expanded business for Minnesota, and business expansion, of course, means more jobs for Minnesota workers.
I will travel and continue to travel to any community in this state, any city in this nation, any corner of the world to bring jobs to Minnesota.
We must remember that Minnesota works best when its people are at work.
****
Jobs for tomorrow depend upon education and training today, which is our other major priority to position Minnesota for the future.
Education is the fuel that drives the engine of economic growth and job creation in America's modern society.
Minnesota has a head start here thanks to the long-standing support of public and private education by our people.
Our education system at all levels is one of the best in the country. But we must and we shall .. do better.
 
Last week I announced a bold, new plan for elementary and secondary education. A plan for access to excellence. This is a plan which ensures that all Minnesotans can participate in determining the highest quality of education for our young people.
Access to excellence will clarify the role of the state strengthen local control increase the
productivity of our students and allow parents and students to make decisions about the quality of education.
This is a plan which allows our young people to realize their full potential and to enjoy the brightest future possible.
In less than three weeks, I will submit a budget which significantly increases support to our post-secondary schools. About one-fifth of our budget will be invested in post-secondary education.
We need a strong vocational-technical system to support the workforce needs of our businesses.
We need a strong community college system to provide life-long learning opportunities for all citizens.
 
We need a strong state university system to educate our young people and to serve the economic development of our regions.
And we need a university which is strong, and world renowned for its graduate programs and research. We have a choice. We can be mediocre or we can be the best. I am sure that we in Minnesota want the best.
I want all Minnesotans to have access to the highest-quality education.
Education for me and many of my generation was a passport out of poverty.
Education for my children and yours will be a passport to prosperity.
Minnesota will become known throughout America and the world as the brainpower state.
Our brainpower will fuel the information-based and technology-based industries already flourishing in our state. It will give rise to new enterprises new ideas and new technologies which can be marketed around the world.

****
These major legislative actions will sustain our momentum and position Minnesota for a strong future.
Mr. Speaker, Mr. President . I view this 1985 session not only as the midpoint of the 1980s, but literally as the turning point for our state.
***
While I am pleased by the progress we have made and while I see many signs for optimism . . I am greatly disturbed by what I see happening in much of rural Minnesota.
It is increasingly apparent that Minnesota is becoming a two-economy state, with prosperity in the metropolitan area and depression in many rural parts of Minnesota.
Although there are now 57,800 more Minnesotans working than ever before in our state's history . . that is no consolation to the steel workers on the Iron Range, to the wood workers in International Falls, to the implement dealers in Dawson or the farmers in Fairmont.
The farm crisis and the severe problems of structural unemployment will require a massive, bipartisan effort that
 
includes a major commitment from Washington. The problem goes far beyond our control. The state can help and we will . . but our Senators and Congressmen must work with us. As a nation pulls together in time of crisis, our state must pUll together in this time of economic disaster in rural Minnesota.
I want to work with all of you in developing permanent, long-term solutions for our economically depressed areas.
To those people .hard-working people whose lives are being devastated .to all who may feel this despair
 let me say that I know from personal experience the heartache you are going through.
I can remember my days growing up in Carson Lake a small mining town on the Iron Range. When my father's lunch box was on the shelf, it meant no work, no income for our family.
I know what it's like to need a job and not have one. I know what it's like to face the loss of home and community, since my hometown of Carson Lake is gone forever.
I want you to know that I will not rest in my efforts until all Minnesotans share in our improving economy.
 
I want you to know, also, that I am committed to making

Minnesota benefit, not suffer, 

from the changes

that are sweeping America and the world.

Resisting change is a losing battle. Shaping change is the real challenge. And accepting change can mean new opportunities.

Many times in my own life I have learned this lesson.

When I was five years old . . . a first generation

American who couldn't speak English,

dedicated

teachers taught me the English language and opened a window

on the world.

Many years later, I suffered the deep personal disappointment that follows a political defeat.

You could not have convinced me that any good could come

from that. But,

in fact, it was a bright, new

beginning.

Again, the world opened up. I learned much more about business, international trade, the arts, the cultures of other people. And I developed a closer bond with my own family.

 
I returned to the Office of the Governor with a new perspective a broader view a clearer vision of what Minnesota can be.

And I entered the job with a new enthusiasm for the state and the people I love.

It's an enthusiasm I believe that flows from a special Minnesota spirit.

A spirit that we saw this holiday season when empty food shelves were filled to overflowing once the call for help went out.

It's a spirit that captures the attention of national observers such as Neil Peirce who, in his Book Of America: Inside The 50 States, he said:

"Search America from sea to sea and you will not find as close a model to the ideal of the successful society as Minnesota."

As we look ahead to the 21st century, just 15

years away

 it occurs to me that we are all immigrants

sailing to a new land.

The technological language and culture of tomorrow are unknown to us today. But I am hopeful as I was when I


first began to learn English as a second language that our voyage into the future will be successful.

By nurturing our sense of family by continuing

our spirit of cooperation by adopting common goals 

by preparing for change

 we can reach our goal.

We can make Minnesota productive and competitive . . and meet the future on our own terms.

Thank you very much.
Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Court, Constitutional Officers, Members of the Legislature, former governors and my fellow Minnesotans.
I can report tonight that the state of our state is sound.
We have overcome major adversities, we are meeting remaining problems boldly, and we are placing Minnesota squarely on course for a stable and prosperous future.
Minnesota is a remarkable state. Minnesotans are exceptional people. And I am deeply grateful and honored for the opportunity to serve longer than any other governor in the history of this state.
The hurdles ahead are great. But the opportunities are even greater. And the special Minnesota spirit is poised for the challenges we face together.
Our objective in the next four years is to bring out the best in Minnesotans to ensure opportunity for our children.
The five-year-olds who enter kindergarten next fall will graduate from high school in the year 2000. We must be sure that all of them have quality job opportunities.
Our goal is to make Minnesota a model state, to make Minnesota the brainpower state, to make Minnesota a world renowned research center.
To meet these objectives, we must focus our efforts in three key areas.
We must have a tax system that is competitive, honest, fair and simple, an education system that is committed to excellence, and a climate of research that will yield the products, ideas and jobs of the future.
Our future extends beyond terms of public office.
We must use our terms of office to shape our vision for the Minnesota of the 21st century.
It was 24 years ago this week that I first took the oath of office as a state senator and began my service to the state of Minnesota. Only one other individual who was here then, still serves today -- Representative Willard Munger -- Mr. Environment.
Representative Munger and I know how long the debate on Minnesota's business climate has raged.

For more than a quarter of a century, we have heard that Minnesota taxes are too high, and that the Minnesota business climate is bad.
I remember well three years ago when I met with a group of Norwegian business executives in Oslo who spoke at some length in negative terms about our business climate, and the perception of Minnesota as a high-tax state has hampered our ability to attract and create more much-needed jobs.
When I took office as governor in 1983, Minnesotans paid more income taxes than citizens of almost every other state.
We took dramatic action over the past four years, including a 25 percent cut in our income taxes, the largest cut of any state in the union.
But more must be done. We must harness the momentum of federal tax reform to initiate a major overhaul of our entire tax system.
This year we will propose the most sweeping reform in the history of this state.
Our tax plan will be the fairest and most thoughtful of any state in the nation this year.
First we will respond to the new federal law by returning the entire state windfall to the taxpayers of Minnesota.
In addition, 125,000 Minnesota low income families will no lo~ger have any state tax liability.
We will also streamline our tax forms.
Our short form will have only five lines. In fact, most people can do it in less than five minutes.
And our long form will be a single page.
Two-thirds of all taxpayers will be able to use the short form.
We will achieve a dramatic reduction in income tax rates.
When I took office in 1983, our top rate on the income tax was nearly 18 percent.
Under our new plan, we will cut that top rate by more than one-half to 8 percent, and we will also have a 6 percent rate for lower incomes.
Our personal income tax will be the fairest and most thoughtful of any state in the nation.

We will apply the same philosophy to our corporate tax.
I am particularly excited about our plan for property taxes and local government aids.
We will greatly simplify our system, which is now the most complicated in the nation.
We will reduce the number of property tax classifications from 68 to 6.
A key element of our program will be to increase the share of state funding for education, which is the cornerstone of our plan for the future.
I propose that the state assume a substantial share of school costs which are now paid for by property taxes.
Our property tax plan, like our income tax plan, will be the fairest and most thoughtful in the nation.
We will apply the same principles of fairness and thoughtfulness to sales tax reform, without taxing food, clothing, services or prescription drugs.
Overall our tax program has several themes: rate reduction, simplification, and fairness.
No longer will Minnesota tax rates be in the top ten in any major tax categories.
I want to repeat that no longer will Minnesota tax rates be in the top ten in any major tax categories.
We will create a better environment for job growth. And from this day forward we will focus all of our energy and ideas on making life better for those who need help most: our beleaguered farmers, our dislocated miners, and the jobless in our cities.
It is a long-standing and unique Minnesota tradition to form partnerships for the benefit of all.
Most recently we saw this Minnesota spirit in a group of people who reached a remarkable consensus on reform of our schools.
The Governor's Discussion Group brought together people with diverse points of view, but a common goal of making ed~cation in Minnesota the best.
This group understood the importance of making Minnesota the brainpower state, and that brainpower is the wellspring of future economic growth.

We will draw from the group's recommendations to make our K-12 education system the best in this nation.
In higher education, we will continue progress toward making' the University of Minnesota a world-class university, one of the top five universities in the nation.
In January 1985, we asked university officials to focus their mission, and they answered with an excellent plan.
The state, in turn, responded with increased funds for faculty salaries, research and financial aid for students.
It is critical that we continue to support the University's efforts as we did in 1985.
The state university system also has moved to clarify its role, and will become the major provider of undergraduate education.
Our state universities will increasingly become regional economic development centers in greater Minnesota, serving as catalysts for long-term economic growth and vitality.
Our community colleges and our AVTI system have more clearly defined their strengths through recent mission statements.
Graduating from a Minnesota AVTI has proven to be a sure-fire way to a job.
In the future, our AVTIs will play an increasingly important role in creating a better future for the working poor, for victims of major economic declines, and for many Minnesotans who seek training and retraining to provide for their families in the years to corne.
The AVTIs in Minnesota are the best in the nation. I am very very proud of them, and I wish each and everyone of you would applaud that system.
Excellent education will pave the way out of adversity for the most dependent Minnesotans.
This will represent real welfare reform.
I am asking the 1987 Legislature to join with me in establishing a goal that I believe is vital to our future as a state.
By the year 2000, I propose that 50 percent of the workforce in Minnesota will have an education two years beyond high school, and that 35 percent will have completed at least four years of college.

Minnesota already has the best high school completion rate of any state, and I propose we set the same goal for higher education.
Our third key area of emphasis must be research, research which will provide the tools of the future and the jobs of tomorrow.
Research and development leading to job creation will offer the best hope for areas of our. state which have been devastated by the changing economics of a nation and world.
The centerpiece of our research and development enterprise will be the Greater Minnesota Corporation, a public private organization that will spearhead the long-term economic recovery of rural Minnesota.
The Greater Minnesota Corporation will work hand-in-hand with colleges and universities throughout the state to translate research into business development and job creation.
Research will be the catalyst for economic diversification in the future as it has been in the past.
Taconite mining research conducted by Dr. Edward Davis over three decades at the University of Minnesota paved the way in the 1950s for a whole new industry for the Iron Range.
In the early 1900s, experiments in manufacturing sandpaper were conducted by a small company in Two Harbors, Minnesota.
This was the beginning of 3M, today a multinational corporation which makes more than forty thousand products and is our state's largest industrial employer.
3M's unrelenting commitment to research has spawned job opportunities throughout Minnesota and throughout the world.
Many new jobs have resulted from major medical advancements that occurred here in Minnesota.
Medtronic and its pacemaker -- which has provided a new lease on life for people throughout the world -- took shape in Earl Bakken's garage about forty years ago.
Advanced surgical techniques and devices to aid the hearing impaired are other examples of research-driven developments that have improved human life and have created new jobs.
Today, state government is in partnership with the University of Minnesota and private business interests to encourage more breakthroughs that will result in new jobs.
Together, we have established the Technology Corridor, the Supercomputer Institute and of course, the biotechnology center.
We have also invested in applied research efforts at Southwest State University to improve the economy of that region.

With all of our accomplishments in research and development, Minnesota must continue to invest in these activities or we will fall behind.
In the year 2000 Minnesotans will live in an economy rich with new ideas, new products and new jobs.
Minnesota will become a world-renowned research center.
Minnesotans have the abilities to meet these goals.
It has been proven time and again that prosperity does not depend on geographic size, location or climate. Nor does it rely on an abundance of energy fuels or other natural resources.
The key is people, our most important resource.
On opposite sides of the world, we have examples of two small nations, Finland and Japan, where people have made a difference.
Finland is similar to Minnesota in climate, its lack of energy resources and its distance from major economic hubs.
Yet this small nation has the 11th best per capita income in the world. It hasn't had a major economic recession since the end of World War II.
Japan is smaller in geographic size than four of our states, has half of the population of the United States, and virtually no petroleum, iron ore, coal or other mineral resources.
Nevertheless, Japan each year has trade surpluses in the billions of dollars, while the exports of much larger nations lag behind.
Minnesota is the only northern state from Pennsylvania to the west coast that experienced economic growth in the past four years.
Japan, Finland, and Minnesota all are places where industrious people made the difference.
So in closing tonight, I want to cite one illustration of the immense human resources of our state.
During the recent around-the-world flight of the Voyager, there were numerous references made to an earlier aviation feat.
Sixty years ago this May, Charles Lindbergh--whose character was forged in a small Minnesota town---stretched the horizons of human achievement in space, when his plane touched down in Paris after a 33-hour flight across the Atlantic.
Charles Lindbergh exemplified the loneliness of leadership, the daring of discovery, and best of the human
it.

He called his plane "The Spirit of St. Louis," but his heart beat with the spirit of Minnesota.
Minnesotans have led journeys of discovery, journeys of learning, and journeys of love.
Minnesotans have proven to be thinkers, leaders, creators and doers.
Let us continue to think, to lead, to create, and to do.
Along with you, I love this state, and I love its people.
Tonight we stand, side by side, as a family on the threshold of the 21st century. We are challenged by those who have blazed the trail before us. This is the pioneering leadership which is the best of Minnesota.
Tonight, I have spoken of three priorities which will move Minnesota forward -- tax reform, education, and a major investment in research.
We must forge our own future.
Minnesota, the model state, Minnesota, the brainpower state, Minnesota, the world-renowned research center.
Minnesota will be-ready for the challenge of the 21st century.
We are limited only by our skills, our determination, and our imagination.
Thank you and good night.Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Court, Constitutional Officers, Members of the Legislature, and my fellow Minnesotans:
Five years ago I stood before you as a newly elected governor and told you that the state of our state was not good. My message at that time was basic - we needed to form partnerships, create jobs and balance our budget. I also said that Minnesota needed a long-range plan to see where we were headed five, ten and twenty years down the road.
We are now five years down that road. Tonight I stand before you to report that the state of our state is good and will continue to get better. We have paid off our debts by forming the partnerships that have put 306,000 people back to work. I'm really proud of that. And we have a longrange plan - a blueprint for job creation ~ to carry us into the 21st century on the strength of brainpower.
Our blueprint is faithful to Minnesota's heritage of action through partnerships. It does not include any quick fixes or free rides. It concentrates on hard work, homework, teamwork and - above all - meaningful work for every Minnesotan.
We are moving ahead with the blueprint on four main fronts.
First, we are improving our system of educational excellence so that our children can become the most creative and talented workforce in the world.
Second, we are expanding our applied research and development programs to transform fresh ideas from the classrooms into high technology jobs for our economy.
Third, we are reforming our tax system and" making our government services more efficient. We are balancing our taxing and spending so that our businesses are profitable and all of our people are given the opportunities that they deserve.

And fourth, we are continuing Minnesota's tradition of strong environmental protection that is so basic to our health and quality of life.
Already, this blueprint for job creation has helped us to act before we have to react. We have replaced budget deficits with a budget reserve that insures us against financial uncertainty. We have dropped Minnesota's tax rate out of the top 10 in every category of personal income tax. After years of being in debt, our Unemployment Compensation Fund is at $145,000,000. Our unemployment tax rate is down to twenty-first in the nation and is lower than three of our neighboring states.
The main reason for this improvement is that we have put people back to work. In the past year alone we created over 70,000 jobs in Minnesota. Over one-half of those jobs, I'm very happy to report to you, were created in Greater Minnesota.
And we have saved jobs, by tackling the tough issues during the most difficult times.
In the midst of the farm crisis we created the first - and the best - farm mediation program in the country. It helped thousands of Minnesota farmers to survive and reap last fall's record harvests. When the federal government saw that Minnesota had the lowest rate of farm bankruptcies among agricultural states, they adopted our mediation program as a national model.

Our share of the national jobs in wood products jumped from 7 percent to 14 percent and our use of wood fuel saved Minnesota consumers $740,000,000.
As we rebuild farming, mining and wood products, our job growth continues in the high
. technology industries such as computers and health care.
It adds up to a strong, robust economy throughout Minnesota.
But there is still plenty of work that needs to be done. The people of Minnesota expect me to back up my beliefs with personal leadership and programs of substance.
That is exactly what I will continue to do.
The legislative proposals I present tonight are bold, but they are not surprising. They continue the familiar theme of jobs, jobs, and mure jobs.
Jobs through educational excellence, jobs through applied research and economic development, jobs through tax reform and jobs through a clean environment.
That is the blueprint. Here are the details.
I begin with education because education lays the foundation for everything we do in Minnesota. It consumes nearly one-half of our state budget. But every cent we invest in education produces dividends in our future economy. .

The same thing with mining - partnerships

saved jobs.



We joined with organized labor, Minnesota Power and Light and the taconite companies to make our taconite industry more competitive in world markets.

This year, everyone of our six plants will be at full production, producing 40,000,000 tons of taconite, our highest output in seven years.

Yet another success is our wood products and timber industry, where the private sector has invested over one billion dollars over the past five years and plans to invest $1,400,000,000 in the next five years.

I am proposing a series of reforms to improve what is already the lowest dropout rate in the nation. Our goal is "96 by 96," a 96 percent graduation rate by the year 1996.
To help our young children who have learning difficulties, I propose that local school districts be given the opportunity to invest in Early Childhood Education programs. We will also increase funding for our Head Start programs. Each dollar we invest in Early Childhood Education saves us nearly five dollars in spending later on.
I also propose that we offer Extended School Day programs in our schools from dawn until dusk. These programs will lower the dropout rate and help bridge the time gap between a normal school day and a normal work day.


In public hearings around the state, I have heard the anguish in the voices of working parents. I've heard this time and time again as they describe the choice between going on welfare and leaving their children alone because they cannot find affordable childcare.
The choice is even more tragic when the parent is in high school. Teenage pregnancy is one reason why one-half of the long-term users of Public Assistance in Minnesota are dropouts.
I am determined to break this cycle of poverty.
Beginning July 1st, school-aged welfare recipients must stay in school to be eligible for full benefits in Minnesota. For this plan to work responsibly, we need childcare for our high schools.
I have visited the childcare facilities in the Technical Institutes. For as long as I have been in public service, nothing has made me feel better than watching the students eat lunch with their child or children, return to class and then go home with their children at the end of the day.
Finally, I propose that state aid be extended to any adult who wants to come back and finish high school.
This package of reforms will deliver the message that it is never too early or never too late to learn in Minnesota. It will confirm that we do not drop people out of our school systems; we keep people in and bring people back so they can earn a diploma and a decent living for themselves and their families.
We will also challenge our students to set higher standards for themselves. So I propose a voluntary Governor's Scholarship Test at the 6th and 10th grade levels. Students who score at the top 25 percent on their test will receive a certificate as a Governor's Scholar. The top two achievers from each school district will be awarded a free quarter of college tuition when they graduate from high school.
I'm sure you can imagine with me the appetite for learning among 6th grade students who have already earned a stake in their post-secondary education!

..

To match that competitive enthusiasm with a sense of civic duty, I also propose naming Governor's Scholars for community service in each school district. By tutoring their classmates and promoting literacy in their neighborhoods, these students would receive the same tuition incentives as the academic scholars.
While visiting Marshall High School in Duluth last fall, I saw for myself the beauty of the best and the brightest students teaching their peers. A gleam of excitement and gratitude was in everybody's eyes. It was contagious. This kind of teamwork continues Minnesota's great heritage of action through partnerships.
It is the kind of teamwork we need if we are to compete effectively in the world economy. The information age-- has taken over the workplace. The jobs of the future rely more and more on applied research and the refinement of ideas.
It used to be that you learned a trade and that was your job security. But today, high-technology jobs are being restructured at least every seven years. Our workers require constant reeducation and training to keep pace with our changing technology.
To protect and prepare our working people, I propose a Minnesota Employment and Training Fund.
This fund would help retrain workers who have been laid-off from long-term employment due to plant closings and other severe shifts in the economy.
It would inspire more Minnesotans like Marilyn Wolfe of Bemidji to discover new skills. In the summer of 1982, Marilyn was a 39-year old single parent of two who had been laid off from her job at U.S. Steel's Minntac Plant at Mountain Iron, Minnesota. She made the courageous decision to go back to school.
Marilyn sold her possessions ana took a series of part-time jobs in order to attend the Technical Institute of Eveleth. After transferring to Bemidji State, she got straight A'son' her first report card. She decided she wanted to maintain that record for four years, and believe it or not she did - a straight 4.0 - all A's!


Last summer Marilyn went to Harvard.
This year she is attending the Yale University School of Organization and Management.
Who knows what this remarkable woman will do next?
I'd like to present to you Marilyn Wolfe!
There is much more that could be said. Her son went back as a mechanical engineer. Her son-in-law, who also had lost his job, will be an electrical engineer. So, from a blue collar family she's creating a family of people all going to college with college degrees. Isn't that wonderful?
I appointed Marilyn to the Minnesota State Board of Vocational Technical Education in 1983. During her two years on the board she constantly worked at finding ways to help nontraditional students to cope with the problems of getting an education.
The Employment and Training Fund is a response to her advocacy and a tribute to her determined spirit, a spirit that should be encouraged in every Minnesotan.
Retraining our workers is one piece of the partnership we need to succeed in the world economy. The other pieces are a first-rate postsecondary educational system and a program for applied research and development. -
We have begun the Commitment to Focus at the University of Minnesota, an important investment in our economic future. As we streamline the University's focus, we must establish our community colleges, our state universities, and our technical institutes as magnets for regional high-technology business growth.
That is why- I have come to Winona this evening. This campus, this city and this region are a perfect example of how partnerships between business and education can stimulate economic development.
Under the outstanding leadership of President Tom Stark, Winona State is an active- participant in a county where the unemployment rate is under five percent.

Thousands of people in this city are designing, manufacturing and selling the high-technology products that shape our future.
The Watlow Company is a world leader in the design of environmental test chambers.
The Fiberite Company makes heat shields for NASA rockets that endure temperatures up to 6,000 degrees.
Both companies are expanding in Winona creating more high-paying jobs to anchor the community.
Winona State's new engineering program is scientifically designed to provide these companies wIth skilled workers from among the local residents. These community partnerships form the essence of our blueprint for job creation.
We can see it in the training provided by the Winona Technical Institute. We can see it in the proposed expansion of the Rochester Center just west of here , where high-tech companies like the Mayo Clinic and IBM will invest in the education of local students to create quality jobs in that community.
At the government level, we must back up our support for these partnerships with' bricks and mortar. Higher student enrollments are bulging the seams of our campus facilities at Mankato Winona, St. Cloud and many other campuses: We must expand to meet the demand. We must develop creative programs like the proposed Agricultural Research Institute and the International Language Villages at Concordia College, Which help us to think globally and act locally.
We must accommodate and channel the brainpower that is crackling in every corner"and community of Minnesota.
Our public-private partnerships are joined toget?er by the Greater Minnesota Corporation, whIch paves a path for innovation from the classroom to the marketplace.
The GMC is the most strategic long-term job growth effort ever launched in Minnesota. It is a public corporation that operates like a business.


To protect itself from politics and swings in the economy, the GMC has invested its seed money. It will operate only on the interest and profits from that investment.
Let me give you just one example of how an applied research program like the Greater Minnesota Corporation can help create jobs in Minnesota.
University researchers in England and an agricultural lab in Illinois have come up with a way to produce biodegradable plastic bags using cornstarch. Consider the possible benefits from this single product.
A new market for millions of bushels of corn from Minnesota farmers.
New jobs for people who produce, market and distribute the bags.
Most important, a product that is compatible with Minnesota's tradition of environmental preservation.
The GMC will speed up the process that turns ideas into jobs.
No wonder former Governor Elmer Anderson has said:
"In launching the Greater Minnesota Corporation, we may have an agency that will be hailed fifty or one hundred years from noW as having generated a new level of prosperity and growth for our state.
"The Greater Minnesota Corporation comes at a strategic moment in the state's history, and can make an enormous contribution in the future."
Governor Anderson is right. To develop the products of tomorrow we need the Greater Minnesota Corporation.
There has been talk of raiding the GMC treasury to finance short-term programs in need of funding. This would be like burning our clothes to stay warm, or, as Senate Majority Leader Roger Moe has said, "It's like eating our seed corn." It's short-term thinking that

would shortchange our efforts to revitalize Greater Minnesota.
Another element of our blueprint for job creation is tax reform.
I have pledged to you that we will have a tax system that is competitive, fair, simple and job-creating, and I have held myself to that pledge despite the pressure of special interest groups.
Let me be specific.
Our competitive tax system cut personal income taxes by 26 percent. We dropped our income tax rate from 4th highest in the nation to 16th.
We cut the corporate tax rate from 12 to 9.5 percent, droppin~ the rate from the highest in the nation to 9th.
We cut our inheritance taxes down to the lowest in the nation.
And just last week, the Minnesota Taxpayers Association lowered Minnesota from 6th to 12th in total state and local tax collections per capita, the lowest ranking we've had in 17 years.
Last year, our Fair Tax System closed loopholes and special tax preferences. We required 8,000 corporate taxpayers to begin paying corporate taxes. We dropped 125,000 low-income Minnesotans from the tax rolls.
As a result, three out of four Minnesotans will be paying the same tax or less tax in 1988 than they were in 1986.
We simplified the tax system which allows two-thirds of Minnesota's taxpayers to fill out a tax form that has been reduced from 46 lines to nine lines.
That's right, from 46 lines to nine lines.
On the other side of the coin, we have increased the efficiency of our government services. We deliver quality services in state government while ranking 47th in the number of state employees on a per capita basis.

Our award-winning STEP program has come up with more than fifty ways to save money and improve services.
STEP is currently the subject of a case study at Harvard. It has quietly made a big impact on our state government and I am very, very proud of the people that are involved.
We will continue to improve government efficiency and reform our tax system.
This year I am proposing a major reform in our property taxes. We will reduce the number of property tax classifications from 68 to 4 and cut our Commercial/Industrial property tax rate by ten percent.
This continues our effort to produce a tax system that is competitive, fair, and simple; a tax system that helps create jobs in Minnesota.
I am confident about our economy, and our ability to create jobs. But the stock market crash on Wall Street and the huge deficits in Washington show us that we must be careful with our money. This means keeping our budget reserve at its current level of $345,000,000.
Last but certainly not least, our blueprint for job creation requires respect for our environment. We are a state of clean air, sparkling blue water, golden prairies and vast green forests. The beauty of our physical environment is Minnesota's blessing. The preservation and maintenance of that beauty is Minnesota's duty and a noble part of its heritage.
We had the nation's first - and strongest acid rain standards. More recently, our Reinvest in Minnesota program helped farmers transform acres of fragile and marginal lands into habitat for our fish and wildlife. But we must continue to be vigilant and take steps to protect our resources before they become endangered.
It is in that spirit that I propose a Comprehensive Waste Reduction and Recycling Act. This Act will help us regulate what goes into our landfills and prevent the contamination of our precious groundwater.

For every 100 bottles and cans we use, We recycle only three of them. The 12.5 million cubic yards of solid waste that we generate each year could fill up the Metrodome a hundred times, or about twice a week. You can see why our landfills are overloaded and why we need to do something about it.

The Recycling Act would coordinate our local recycling programs and give them enough money to be effective.

This money would come from a small deposit on beverage containers and a fee on non-degradable plastics that can't be recycled. Every Minnesotan should have the opportunity to recycle and to protect our groundwater. Passing this Recycling Act will give us that opportunity.

The final proposal I will make tonight will correct a basic flaw in our Environmental Protection Plan - the lack of a long-term funding source. Piecemeal funding for our environment is not enough. The truth is, adjusting for inflation, the money we spend to protect our natural resources has not grown over the past twelve years.

This is why I propose a Minnesota Environment and Natural Resources Trust Fund. This trust fund will provide the stable, long-term source of money needed for the care of our land, our air and our water.

The great Minnesota Naturalist Sigurd Olson has said:

"Our most important goal is preservation of

the land which is our home. To survive, we must

be eternally vigilant and embrace the broad concept of an environmental ethic."


The Minnesota Environment and Natural Resource Trust Fund would establish that environmental ethic so necessary to the survival of our children and grandchildren.

To fund this long-term initiative, I propose that the Legislature put the question of a state lottery on the ballot for the people to decide. And if the people approve the lottery, I propose that half of the proceeds be earmarked for the Environmental Trust Fund, and that the other

half go for the Greater Minnesota Corporation. This would provide us with tremendous environmental and job-creating benefits for decades to come.
A common thread has run through the proposals I have made this evening. They each represent durable policy, and focus on creating jobs both now and in the future.
From our "96 by 96" reforms and our bonding bill for education to our Employment and Training Fund....
To the Greater Minnesota Corporation To comprehensive tax reform ... Up to our Environmental Trust Fund The components of our blueprint for job creation prepare us for a secure and prosperous life - both now and in the 21 st century. We have worked long and hard to get to this point. We have carved out a program for educational excellence that has become a national model. We have established a public corporation for economic development that has the savvy, the flexibility and the clout to create jobs in Minnesota. We have totally overhauled our tax system. We have used the resources of our environment with a healthy respect for the consequences. Now we are poised and determined to follow through on our blueprint for job creation. I look forward to working with the Legislature to enact this blueprint, forming the legislative partnership that expresses the will of our people. I will tell you quite simply that I love the land and the people of Minnesota with all my heart. I am proud of the heritage that is Minnesota. And I will do everything in my power to uphold that heritage. Thank you and good night.Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court, Constitutional Officers, members of the Legislature, former Governors - I want to take this opportunity for a little nostalgia. Fifty years ago, 26-year-old C. Elmer Anderson and 32-year-old Harold Stassen became Lieutenant Governor and Governor of Minnesota - 50 years ago today. I ask them both to stand at this time.
My fellow Minnesotans - in 1983, Minnesota's unemployment rate was over 10 percent.
We had lost our triple-A credit rating.
Our budget was on the brink of bankruptcy.
And we had no rainy-day fund.
Today - in 1989 - the State of our State is much stronger.
Our unemployment rate is at four-and-a-half percent.
Over the past six years - we have created more than 340,000 jobs in Minnesota.
Our credit rating has been upgraded, and deficit spending has been replaced by sound fiscal management.
We have a rainy-day fund for financial emergencies that now totals 550 million dollars.
Together, we have been through bad times and good.
Consistently, from the bad times of 1983 to the good times of 1989 - the central goal of this administration has been the same -
Job Creation.
From the bad times of 1983 to the good times of 1989, we have focused on job creation through partnerships in four. key areas - 
Jobs through education ...
Jobs through research and development ...
Jobs through a clean environment ...

And jobs through tax reform and sound fiscal management.
Tonight, I ask once again that we continue this tradition of job creation.
First - by building the world's best education system.
Second - by fostering research and development.
Third - by maintaining the finest quality of life through a clean environment.
And fourth - by improving the business climate through tax reform.
We begin with education because our jobs and the jobs of our children will depend upon the quality of our educational system.
Just as our parents lifted themselves up by their bootstraps, our children will move themselves forward on the strength of their brainpower.
Four years ago today - on January 4th, 1985 - we launched an education plan known as "Access to Excellence" -
A plan that the Christian Science Monitor has since called - "The most intensive, substantial effort at education reform in United States history."
Under Access To Excellence, we are the first state to establish the right of students to choose the schools and the programs best suited to their needs.
Under Access To Excellence, we were the first state in the union to allow high school students to take classes at colleges and universities at state expense.
Under Access To Excellence, we have provided a variety of education options for students who have dropped out or who are at risk of dropping out of school.
And under Access To Excellence - we enable students to choose an elementary or secondary school on the basis of quality and compatibility with their needs.
Choice works.
If you have any doubts, consider Stacy Condon of Minneapolis.

Earlier this year, Stacy's mother wrote to tell me what a difference Access To Excellence had made in the Condon family.
Two years ago, Stacy was ranked in the lower third of her high school class, and planned to quit school at the age of 16.
But after enrolling in our post-secondary enrollment options program, Stacy discovered the joy and the power of learning.
Last June, she simultaneously graduated from high school and completed her first year of college with a full 45 credits and a highB average.
"Stacy had the ability to succeed," her mother wrote, but "without an alternative educational program, I'm convinced she would not have graduated."
Stacy's mother ended her letter' with these words: "There is ao doubt in my mind that the money spent to support Stacy through this program will be repaid many times over in the form of taxes generated through higher earnings and the personal contributions she will make as an educated member of our society."
At this time I would like to introduce Stacy Condon and her mother, Marilyn. Would you please stand. We are very proud of you, Stacy.
Stacy's story will be repeated time and time again throughout Minnesota if we provide the information necessary for our students to make informed choices.
Four years ago, I said that our educational system should be strengthened through competition and accountability.
Last month, the legislative auditor issued a report on our educational system,_ that affirmed the need for greater accountability.
Tonight - as I did in 1985 - I am calling for statewide testing.
Testing will be conducted in the core curriculum areas of math, science, English and social studies at both the 6th and 10th grade level.
The state will publish the results on a district-by-district basis.

Testing will provide information that helps parents and students choose which schools best fit the students' needs.


Choice, supported by testing, will create a marketplace for education that is accountable and responsive to the individual needs of our students.
Competition in education through school choice is the way to build the world's best educational system, and continue our tradition of job creation.



Research and development is the second consistent component of our job creation strategy.
Over the past six years, private industry research has focused more on short-term investments. At the same time, the federal government has concentrated its research in highly classified areas of defense.
We have accepted the challenge of filling in the research gap, to create another generation of 3Ms, Blandins and Crays for the 21 st century.

In 1983, we began building engineering schools in St. Cloud, Mankato and Duluth, and a Natural Resources Research Institute at UMD.

Since then we've added another engineering school in Winona, a Supercomputer Institute at the University of Minnesota, and two months ago began work on four Agriculture Research and Utilization Institutes.

These agricultural institutes will develop technologies that create new uses for our crops and expand markets for our farmers.

Last year, I showed you a biodegradable plastic bag made from cornstarch, using a technology that researchers say could use up to 500 million bushels of corn a year.

Another agricultural product with great potential is a printing ink made from soybeans.

This newspaper - Agri-News - is just one of the many publications in Minnesota and across the country that are being printed with a soybean-based ink.

As with biodegradable bags, this product is opening new markets and increasing demand for crops grown by our farmers.

We have established the Greater Minnesota Corporation as the centerpiece of our research and development effort.
The GMC is up and running - and already is earning respect.
The Chicago Tribune has called it the most far-reaching state plan for research and technology in the country.
And here in Minnesota, the St. Paul Pioneer Press-Dispatch has written that the GMC is on a course that "should bring economic development projects to both rural "and urban areas of the state," and "would expand Minnesota's role as one of the nation's leading science and technology states."
The fact is that research and development represents the most dynamic force' for job creation in the global economy.
President Reagan has said that technology will lead to a new industrial revolution.

Soviet President Gorbachev has called technology the key to transforming his nation's economy.
The Japanese are counting on technology to make them the economic superpower of the 21st century.
The competition is fierce - but our
commitment is strong and our vision is clear.
Whether it is research and development for
agriculture or biotechnology, for supercomputers or natural resources, Minnesota will
take a back. seat to no one when it comes
to turning the ideas of the classroom into products for the global marketplace.
Our commitment to research and development will make Minnesota one of the nation's
leading science and technology states.


The third consistent component in our job creation strategy is firmly embedded in Minnesota's great heritage - the protection and preservation of our environment.

In 1983, the Conservation Foundation conducted a survey to see which states  if any - could simultaneously develop their economy and protect their environment.
When the group issued its report, Minnesota was ranked number one for protecting our environment while developing the economy.
Since then, we have lived up to our position of national leadership in this field.
In 1983, we created a state Superfund to clean up toxic waste.
In 1986, we passed the Re-Invest In Minnesota program to protect thousands of acres of land as wildlife habitat.
Finally, in November of 1988, the people of Minnesota overwhelmingly endorsed the creation of an Environment and Natural Resources Trust Fund, the first of its kind in the nation.
These are just a few of the reasons why the Nature Conservancy has said - "When looking for leadership in natural areas protection, we and other conservation organizations throughout the nation have always looked with respect and admiration to Minnesota."
As the nation looks to Minnesota in 1989, our environmental leadership will continue.
The drought of last year taught us that our water resources are fragile and require constant care to ensure their proper use.
In the coming weeks - I will outline a program for water protection.
And I will talk about our vision for an Environmental Compact of the States.
We know that many of the challenges to our environment extend beyond the borders of a single state.
These challenges require national cooperation and national leadership.
As the chair of the Education Commission of the States, I have seen bow effectively states can work together through a national partnership to address common concerns in education.

I believe an Environmental Compact of the States - headquartered right here in Minnesota - can bring Americans together in a similar fashion to address common concerns about the environment.
As an official from the Natural Resources Defense Council has said - "There have always been some states like Minnesota that have been out in the forefront and didn't need the federal government to tell them what to work on."
An Environmental Compact of the States will once again prove the truth of that statement, and will help safeguard the clean environment that is critical to our tradition of job creation.
The fourth and final consistent component of our job creation strategy is tax reform through sound fiscal management.
Back in the difficult days of 1983, when there were many demands on our revenues, I offered the challenge that we tighten our belts and establish a budget reserve - a rainy day fund to protect us from shifts in the economy.
Today, while the federal government faces a mountain of debt, and states from California to Massachusetts and from New York to Arizona wrestle with cutting services or raising taxes to balance their budgets, we have kept our rainy-day fund secure.
This policy of sound fiscal management will continue.
Failure by the federal government to solve the federal budget deficit and to correct the trade imbalances could have severe adverse effects on the Minnesota economy, as well as the rest of the nation.
Even as we experience an economic boom in many parts of the state, and even as there are funding requests for many worthy programs, I will call again for budget restraint to protect us against the effects of any possible downturns in the economy.
We tightened our belts in the difficult days of 1983. We know we can hold the line on spending in 1989.


In previous speeches - I have said that our first and foremost objective is to make Minnesota competitive with the rest of the country.
Since that time, we have lowered our corporate tax from 12 to 9.5 percent.
We cut our individual income tax rate in half.
We reduced our inheritance taxes from among the highest in the nation to among the lowest in the nation.
And our unemployment compensation rates are now 21 st in the nation.
We are proud of these successes.
In 1989 - our work on tax reform will continue.
Property taxes remain a major problem for many Minnesotans.
I am committed to reducing property taxes where the burdens are the highest - for middle-value homesteads, apartments, rental homes, and for businesses.
We must also reform the way the state finances local government operations.
Sixty-five percent of all state tax dollars are sent back to schools and local governments.
I will be proposing ways to improve the fairness and efficiency of this property tax system.
Property tax reform will further improve our business climate - which has turned around in the past six years.
In 1983, everyone talked about a job drain from Minnesota to North Dakota and South Dakota.
But in 1989, the man who was Governor of North Dakota six years ago - Allen Olson - goes to work at his job in Minnesota.
And in 1989, the man who was Governor of South Dakota six years ago - Bill Janklow - also works in Minnesota.
The fact is that there are more than seven business start-ups or expansions in Minnesota every single day of the year.

That is a net start-up and expansion figure that takes into account the businesses you read about that leave this state.
Furthermore, the failure rate of Minnesota businesses is 45 percent lower than the national average.
The bottom line is that not only do we create jobs in Minnesota - we preserve and enhance the jobs that we have created.
In every region of the state last year, businesses responded to the brainpower and productivity of Minnesota's workers.
The Swift Meat Company expanded its operations in Worthington, calling it the crown jewel of its national operation.
IBM chose its employees in Rochester to design and manufacture its newest line of computers.
The Deluxe Check Corporation created 1,500 manufacturing jobs through its expansion in Shoreview.
And in the largest private sector industrial expansion in Minnesota history, Boise Cascade is investing one-half billion dollars into its paper mill in International Falls.
These expansions by our top corporate citizens create tens of thousands of jobs and deserve to make headlines.
They represent the essence of the Minnesota spirit, and the essence of our tradition of job creation.
Since 1983, you have heard me say that my top three goals as Governor are jobs, jobs and more jobs for the people of this state.
I would like to close this evening by sharing my thoughts on what a job means to me..
A person with a job knows that he or she can do something well enough to be paid for it, and that knowledge provides dignity and hope.
A job gives a person the power to dream, and the strength to work toward the fulfillment of that dream.

I have seen the way people who do not have a job are treated.
I have seen the struggle and the quiet desperation that many of them endure.
Many of you have heard me talk about growing up on the Iron Range where my father was an iron ore miner.
When he had a job, our family was happy.
But I learned at a very young age that when my father's lunch bucket was on the shelf, there would be no job for him that day and less income for the family.
The longer that lunch bucket stayed on the shelf, the less my father would speak, and the more I would see tears on my mother's face.
Through those hard times, my parents held the family together with love and hard work - and taught my brothers and me the meaning of a job.
Tonight I would like to publicly introduce my mother and father, Mary and Anton Perpich - the first time they have attended one of my State of the State speeches.
And I would like to thank them for the examples that they set for me, and the lessons that they gave to me, on the value of never giving up, or giving in to despair.
I thought of my parents and my childhood often during the early part of this decade when Minnesota was hit with a double depression in our mining and farm economies.
We all read in the papers of the number of jobs lost, and we saw mining towns like Babbitt and Silver Bay devastated - and Main Street businesses in farm towns like' Benson and Appleton and Slayton closing their doors.
Back in those difficult days, I knew that behind each number in the jobs-lost column was a family struggling to survive.
And behind the doors in the homes of those mining and farm families, there were people suffering in silence and tears.
It was during that time that I decided that jobs would be the central and overriding goal of this administration.
10

And it was during that time that I developed a job creation strategy, based on the belief that every single one of us deserves the chance to make a better life through a job that pays a decent wage.
In every State of the State message since 1983, this strategy for job creation has remained consistent.
Tonight I renew my pledge to the people of Minnesota, that as long as I am Governor - in boom times and recession, in good times and bad - I will remain consistent in my efforts to create jobs.
Jobs through education . Jobs through research . Jobs through a clean environment ... And jobs through tax reform. Together, we will carry our tradition of job creation forward... Today, tomorrow, and into the future ... where our hopes, dreams and accomplishments await us. Thank you and good night.Mr. Speaker, mr. President, mr. Chief justice, members of the court, constitutional officers, members of the legislature, former governors, people of Minnesota. Eleven weeks ago i asked Minnesotans to tell me how drugs affected their lives.
And here is what they said.

Drugs destroy lives. Drugs have no place in Minnesota. No place in our schools no place in our neighborhoods. No place in our families. Drugs have overwhelmed other states but not Minnesota. Minnesota leads the nation because Minnesota met the drug problem head-on. Over half a century beginning at willmar state hospital and then at hazelden Minnesota developed a program for treating addiction. Known as the Minnesota model the program saves lives all over the world. Most states would be satisfied having given the world a treatment program but Minnesota has done more. Minnesota always does more. In Minnesota we build on our success. Since 1983 we have more than doubled funding for alcohol and drug prevention programs in our schools. In 1983 we created the criminal justice task force. In 1985 we created the chemical dependency treatment fund. Minnesota was the first state to provide drug treatment on demand. In 1986 Minnesota's plan for using federal anti-drug money was recognized as a model for the nation. In 1987 we created the high school graduation incentives program which gives students with drug problems a chance to start over.

In 1989 ... Based in part ... On the work of the criminal justice task force we passed tougher criminal penalties for people who possess or sell drugs.
In 1989 ... We also enacted the "year of the city." we are rebuilding neighborhoods ... Training the unemployed ... And providing mental health care and child care.
Drugs will not disappear unless our communities are healthy. Our drug policy is comprehensive ... We treat both the individual and the community.
We in Minnesota government always do more than expected ... Because the people of Minnesota always do more than expected.
During the last six weeks ... I have met with people dedicated to chasing drugs and crime from their neighborhoods.
In minneapolis.. I visited with members of the whittier neighborhood who are forcing landlords to evict tenants who run crack houses.

In st. Paul ... I met with nick davis ... One of the heroes of the drug war. Nick and his neighbors are chasing drug dealers out of their neighborhood. Minnesotans know that apathy is the drug dealer's greatest ally. Minnesotans are willing to organize their communities against drugs ... But they need guidance and they need funding. The state will supply both. As governor ... I am determined to multiply neighborhood drug programs. With every Minnesota neighborhood organized against drugs ... We will have a strike force four million people strong. Four million people fighting the spread of drugs. Four million people helping those addicted to drugs. Minnesota ... I am proud to say ... Provides treatment on demand. Most areas of the country have long waiting lists. With drugs ... Delay means death. Waiting lists in Minnesota will never be acceptable. We must increase funding for our chemical dependency treatment fund. We must also continue to develop specialized treatment programs.

Last week i visited the four winds program in brainerd ... A treatment program developed specifically for native americans. The program combines native american history and culture with a modern treatment program.
The four winds program works. Specialized treatment programs work.
I am also asking for resources to develop aftercare programs. We must help people as they adjust to drug-free lives.
Drug-free lives for all Minnesotans ... That is my goal. A goal we will not reach until we decide that drug use is unacceptable. As unacceptable as slavery ... As unacceptable as torture.
Drug addiction is a form of slavery ... It is a form of torture.
Until Minnesotans harden their minds against drug use ... We will need a strong criminal justice system to shield us from the violence of drugs.
To improve law enforcement ... I recommend we hire more agents for the bureau of criminal apprehension ... Expand training of local police ... And provide funds to local law enforcement task forces.
And to help courts respond quickly i recommend 12 new judges.

In addition ... I ask the legislature to expand sentencing alternatives and supervised probation so nonviolent criminals can be dealt with more effectively. I also ask the legislature to expand the drug treatment programs in prisons. No one should ever leave prison with a craving for drugs. The theme of my speech is "building on success." in the fight against drugs ... Minnesota schools are our greatest success. Those who despair about the drug crisis should look here at jefferson high school.. And down the street at olson junior high. Both schools have nationally recognized drug prevention programs. Currently every school in the state is required by law to have a drug prevention program. I am determined that every school in Minnesota will have a drug program as good as the one here at jefferson. Let's give jefferson high school a big hand for doing such a great job. We have already more than doubled funding for school drug programs. I will ask the legislature to fund more career teachers and non-profit providers so students receive individualized attention.

And finally.. I will be proposing an increase in funding to schools so that the dare program and project charlie are available to more schools. Project charlie was created in edina 13 years ago. On a visit to woodland elementary in eagan ... I was impressed by the way project charlie got the message about drugs to children. We must bring the dare program and project charlie to more schools in Minnesota. And to reach children early ... We must involve parents. The early childhood family education program ... Strengthens families by teaching parents to help their children. Children with supportive parents are better prepared for school and have greater self-confidence. We must expand this program up to the third grade. I am also seeking an increase in funding for head start so we can serve more children ... Especially homeless children . . Head start graduates do better in school ... They do better at home ..And they do better in life. Yet only 30 percent of eligible children participate in the program.

No matter how good our teachers are ... And our teachers are the best ... There is one group of children no school alone can help. The children of addicts.
Children born addicted to drugs. Children beaten, abused and neglected.
I will propose legislation to help these children. But we can't legislate a perfect world. I need your help. We must unite to protect the children. We must unite to protect ourselves. And we must unite four million strong. To drive drugs from Minnesota.
I have asked students from bloomington to join me in a . Pledge against drugs. The pledge is in your program.
So will you please stand and join us ... A small segment of Minnesota ... As we recite this pledge:

I pledge never to use drugs to help those addicted to drugs and to fight the spread of drugs until we are the first state in the nation drug free.
I want to thank each and every one of you for pledging your support to make Minnesota drug free. Thank you very much.
