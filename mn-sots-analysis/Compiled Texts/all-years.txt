Mr. Speaker, Members of the Legislature, the Judiciary, Constitutional

Officers, and Citizens of Minnesota.

1. Welcome, not only to a new Session, but a renewed capitol. With these  updated facilities and with standing committees having been holding weekly
sessions, you will have an opportunity to test whether 120 days is now ample time to accomplish the necessary business.
I appear before you for two reasons. I want to, and I am instructed to. The Minnesota Constitution says: The Governor shall communicate by message
to each Session of the Legislature such information touching the State and
condition of the country as he may deem expedient.

1968 was a year short on joy and long on violence and sorrow. A year in

which we saw the fantastic success of Apollo VIII and the seizure of universities by militants, the tragedy of Chicago, the paralysis of New York, and the

slaying of a national leader and a presidential candidate. It was a year which brought almost more history than a people can bear.

We meet today at a time when the world seems cruel and often absurd. Many of our people are cynical, disillusioned, frustrated, bitter. Other nations doubt us we doubt ourselves.
The public looks to governmental institutions and sees scores of federal
programs which haven't really made the dent on poverty and hunger that was
intended. It hears about the passage of glamorous programs, then learns they haven't been funded. The American people agonize as their sons die in Viet

Nam while negotiators in Paris quibble about the shape of a table.


Large numbers of students are legitimately frustrated with educational
institutions that sometimes get in the way of learning. A smaller but more
vocal group on campuses from Columbia to Oshkosh to San Francisco seek not to
change the system but to destroy it.
Some adults, questioning the religious institution, are disrupting their
worship services, and a good share of the young never even bother to go.
Whether you look at government, education, religion or business, the
11 pressure and strain on these institutions has brought them to the breaking
point.
For too long we've been worshipping their great empty forms, forgetting
to see if their spirit was dying. For too many aLmost 70% of all Americans 1969 doesn't look much
 different or looks worse than 1968 because our institutions seem uninter-
ested or incapable.
Our people cry out for systems that serve the individual first and solve his problems best. If we should fail to hear that plea or neglect it, we as a people are in deep trouble. Then there is no hope for this nation, no future for democracy. Either in a fit of rage and passion we can demolish our institutions, or we can recognize that individuals renew institutions. Individuals with the
courage to ask "Does the system serve?" and "Whom does it serve?" Individuals with the creativity and energy to answer, "How it can serve." Given the resolve for service, we can fashion the kind of society our forefathers could only dream of.
" I am confident we have such men. For over 175 years, the U.S. has been bombarded with problems. Yet our people have marched through history with a sense of purpose and a hope in tomorrow. They were a strong people who saw
in America a vision of greatness. We, too, have that strength. If we did not, surely there would have been no Apollo VIII. To me, this is an exceptional time to be alive. Maybe not the best of times that may be too much to ask but certainly an open and exciting

time

a time of opportunity.

We, like our forebears, are genuinely committed to solving the problems

of the past and easing the problems of the present. But in addition, for the first time in history, a people have wholeheartedly assumed the arduous task
of trying to anticipate and avoid the problems of the future. Part of the reason our problems seem so king-sized, so overwhelming, is
,I not because we as a people are less able to deal with them than our predecessors, but precisely because we are perhaps one of the most sincerely dedicated problem-

solving generations that has ever emerged. We are trying to solve more at one
time than any other generation. Therefore, the issue before America is can we renew our institutions so
they advance, not get in the way of, our commitment.

We, in these halls, are charged with a special responsibility to the institution of government. It is our challenge to seek to restore the people's

faith in the capacity of government to respond to the public's will, and sense its need. The issue before us is simple. Can we re-think, adapt, innovate,
and streamline the institution of government to fully equip it to solve today's I problems and tomorrow's demands? I believe we can.
We demonstrated two years ago by such acts as creating a Metropolitan

Council, a Department of Human Rights, a Minnesota Pollution Control Agency, a modernized Department of Economic Development, an accelerated highway program, and many others that State Government can meet modern needs. But we cannot, and I am sure we will not, rest on past achievements. We must demonstrate again this Session that we will not coast. We will take another gigantic step forward in this Decade of Decision.
That step will require action on such important subjects as reorganizing the Executive Branch of State Government, combatting crime, fully guarding the consumer, enhancing our environment, guaranteeing quality education, improving safety and health services, encouraging sound metropolitan development, increasing job opportunities and safety, aiding agriculture, promoting hmnan rights and helping our Senior Citizens. 

Consequently, the first special message I shall send to you will outline the reorganization of the Executive Branch of State Government. No wonder the public is frustrated by the organization of State services. If a man seeks vocational rehabilitation services, there. is a myriad of separate programs scattered throughout five major state agencies. And the frustration for the man who deals with the government occasionally compounds to a mammoth headache for us who work in government daily.
The present structure of the Executive Branch of State Government is an administrative puzzle built by happenstance. Right now, under the jurisdiction of the Governor, there are 84 executive offices, agencies, boards and commissions, some with administrative, quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial authority, or all three. Furthermore, there are 108 advisory bodies, 80 intra-state regional or

interstate bodies, and 11 semi-state or state-related boards or commissions. That means 283 groups that are individually and directly responsible to the Governor.
The reorganization of the Executive Branch is essential to providing efficiency, service and accountability to the people.
Given the effective tools for problem solving, we can set about to prove to our people that a government of, by and for the people really works.
see no reason why this State Government should not be a national leader in rebuilding our people's faith in government in its ability to perform. But the only way to merit their trust is to solve their problems.
Therefore, let me briefly discuss the major problem areas we face this Session.

To my mind and to the minds of Minnesotans, one of the first and fundamental responsibilities of State and Local Government is to protect our people from fear. Fear that comes from:
A burglary every 20 minutes, An auto theft every hour, A robbery every three hours, An aggravated assault every five hours, A forcible rape almost every day. Those are Minnesota statistics. Therefore, I serve notice today on those who prey upon their fellow citizens that law enforcement is a prime and constant concern of this Administration.

That is why we formed the Governor's Crime Commission. That is why those 102 men and women have worked so earnestly. That is why you will be receiving a special message. The message will be detailed and comprehensive, covering crime prevention, law enforcement, and administration of justice, and corrections. 

Another special message shall be presented on a topic of vital interest to every Minnesotan safeguarding the consumer. It will cover a range of legislation directed to inform and safeguard the consumer. I urge your thorough consideration and early passage of sound laws to implement reorganization, to fight crime and to provide consumer protection.
As I said earlier, this generation is unique in its commitment to not only trying to ease the problems of the past and present, but for the first time earnestly striving to avoid problems in the future. 


Nowhere is this particular characteristic more obvious than in the issue of enhancing our environment.
Minnesota has a chance to enhance and cleanse its environment before it is too late. Other states have not been so lucky. The challenge of this Administration and this Session is to save our natural resources.
A. Minnesota's Crystal Waters Program Look first at our water resources. As the land of 15,000 lakes, the
source of the Mississippi, and the western shores of the Great Lakes, with three million acres of water, we don't have much choice. To desecrate our

waters is to destroy our State.

1. The accelerated construction of sewage treatment facilities

would have a tremendous impact on saving pure waters. This is a race against

time. Money spent now would save millions of dollars in inflated construction

costs of facilities which must be built later and save additional millions in

the cost of reclamation projects to restore polluted water.

Right now, nearly Fifty-five Million Dollars of treatment plant

construction is ready to go, on the basis of the community paying 70% of the

cost and the Federal Government 30%. Fifteen Million plus has been authorized

by the Federal Government for its share but only Four Million plus has been

appropriated. The whole program has come to a halt. We cannot wait upon the

fancies and defaults of the Federal Government. This State can and should

act now

not only to aid those now marking time but others who are ordered

to install facilities 

Therefore, I recommend a statewide bonding program to aid local

communities with 30% of construction costs. State funds would be a grant to

municipalities unless or until the Federal Government appropriates sufficient

money to fully fund the presently authorized program. At that time, federal

funds coming to the municipality will reimburse the State.

In the coming Biennium, we will willingly and confidently invest

over Seven Hundred Million Dollars for current expenses for education. Certainly

we can afford a Twenty Million Dollar Bonding program to be repaid over a 20-year

period with the likelihood of substantial federal reimbursement which would

enable us to avoid the catastrophic contamination of our environment. This is

the first part of a four-part Minnesota Crystal Waters Program.

2. In the second part of the crystal Waters Program, the State guarantees responsible lakeshore and lake use regulations to preserve the beauty and life of our lakes.
3. The third recommendation authorizes a study and demonstration project for reclaiming polluted lakes.
4. The last proposal of the Crystal Waters Program requires the consolidation of water resource management now distributed among eight water . related boards into one major state agency.
B. In addition, with greater leisure time for more people to use our natural resources, a conservation-education coordinator is urgently needed to incorporate into the curriculum instruction in wild life values and environmental preservation and acquaint teachers with essential elements of such a program.
But I think we would be the first to admit that not all of the problems of our environment nor its potential for development have been thoroughly explored.
We had five million visits to our State Parks last year. We are just beginning to appreciate the tremendous economic and recreational and historic significance that the Voyageurs National Park will have in Minnesota. The proposal for a Voyageurs National Park, which had received endorsement from the legislatively created Outdoor Recreation and Resources Commission, was introduced as a bill in the last session of Congress. The bill had the support of the entire Minnesota Congressional delegation and will be reintroduced and pushed this session.
We need an intensive study with an early due date on the following three important environmental questions. C. To determine the feasibility of a summer arts facility set in one of
Minnesota's unique natural sites for the study and performance of the visual and performing arts.
D. To analyze the possibilities of a user fee for public waters, which would be a State charge for the use, appropriation or contamination of State waters, be they lakes, streams, or underground systems.
E. To determine a State policy on the funding of dam reconstruction. Many dams constructed in the 1930's are in need of extensive and expensive repair. A State policy on the funding and reconstruction of dams is necessary.
F. Lastly, I urge you to design a program to save space precious space. I strongly recommend a Ten Million Dollar statewide bonding program to fill out some of our existing State Parks and to acquire open space for future recreational uses. Care should be taken that any such acquisition program should be closely coordinated with appropriate planning authority in the area such as the Metropolitan Council in the metropolitan area.
With such a comprehensive program to enhance our environment, we can make sure that in the year 2000 our children can enjoy Minnesota's vast natural resources. It is not too soon to plan for the year 2000. One-half of the people living in Minnesota now will not have reached their fiftieth birthday at the turn of the century. 

Another major challenge of the 1969 Session is improving the quality of education offered to our young people.
The importance of education is obvious. No man is free in any meaningful sense of the word until his mind is free. Then his choices are open, his reach limitless. Little wonder a stable democracy is predicated on a sound education.
Historically, Minnesotans have honored that concept with a tremendous educational investment. During the last two years, we built over 3,330 classrooms, put 417 needy students in college on a new state scholarship program, and saw a 141% increase in the number of people served by vocational rehabilitation, and had the lowest drop-out rate in the nation. In fact, the appropriation for education in this biennium totaled more than the entire state budget just seven years ago.
But we aren't about to rest on our laurels. We can expand the opportunity for education, improve the quality of education, and refine the structure of the educational system.
In pursuit of those goals, I recommend: A. Expanding the State's investment in our young people by a tenfold
increase in our state scholarship program and giving our Indian scholarship program the biggest increase in its history.
B. Strengthening the Higher Education Coordinating Commission by giving it a more prominent role in placing programs and locating new facilities, reviewing budgets and enlarging citizen representation.
C. Granting planning funds for new junior colleges. The Higher Education Coordinating Commission has recommended six new junior colleges be built. Manifestly, they cannot all be constructed in one biennium. We must move now to ease the enormous enrollment pressures on our junior colleges.
D. Since we have committed ourselves to trying to avoid problems in the future, we must realize that behind tomorrow stands not only a problem

but a possible catastrophe. Sixteen percent of our elementary and secondary

students are presently being educated in non-public schools. The enrollment

in private schools had steadily increased for decades until 1963. Since 1963,

the enrollment has dropped 20%, 20% in five years.

Private colleges educated 34% of our students ten years ago, today it is

22%. The result is an immediate, sometimes intolerable burden on the taxpayer,

who must then provide many more public facilities, teachers and administrators.

Consequently, I recommend either a legislative or executive committee be

established and funded to determine the impact the decline of private schools

will have on the taxpayer and to recommend alternate courses for State action.

E. Certain school districts face peculiar circumstances such as

loss of tax base or a rapidly growing student enrollment which outstrips the

tax base. Therefore, to tailor the assistance to the need, consideration

should be given to enlarging the category of special aid to school districts

encountering unusual problems beyond their control.

F. Teacher retirement benefits have always been a weak spot. To

solve the pressing needs of the present and to meet the inflation and changing

conditions of the future, a plan for improvement has been recommended by the

Legislative Commission on Public Employee Retirement Systems with approval by

State teachers' organizations. I endorse that plan and request its early

enactment.

am dedicated to the quality of education and firmly committed to seeing

our young people profit by it. My budget message shall reflect my best judgment

on how we can strike the proper. balance between the desirable and the doable.

The fifth issue Minnesotans are putting before this Legislature will be a
true test of government's problem solving ability. If we honestly commit
ourselves to solving problems, we cannot weasel out of the tough ones.
The gap between our performance and our potential in securing the health
and safety of our people is a cruel and intolerable contradiction. We know more and more about the ugly effects of drug abuse and yet last
year, examinations by the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension on suspected narcotics
violations were up 160% over 1967.
We know more about highway safety and last year we set a new record in
highway deaths. We know more about family medicine but have fewer family doctors.
The time is long overdue for this State to commit itself to a broadscale
program to secure the health and safety of our people. Therefore, I ask you to
consider:
A. The creation of a central state source to collect and disseminate information for drug education. Such a central agency would also coordinate
and integrate the volunteer activities of several interested disciplines
pharmacy, pharmacology, medicine, law, sociology, psychology.
B. I strongly urge action to provide more general medical practitioners
in Minnesota. C. I ask the Higher Education Coordinating Commission to explore the
possibility of expanding programs to train paramedical personnel in our junior
colleges and vocational technical schools.
We must continue to move forward in our efforts to care for the retarded in the context of his own community. During the 1967-68 biennium, there was an increase of 125% in the number of mentally retarded served by day care centers. In my budget message I shall strongly recommend a greatly expanded appropriation for day care centers and sheltered workshops. In addition, in order that we may move effectively in the direction of community care for the mentally retarded, I also request this Legislature require all school districts to conduct a census of all school age children
E. My budget message will reflect my concern for the care of the mentally ill in our institutions, as well as stronger support for mental health centers.
F. I will also recommend an increased appropriation for the proper care of the blind and the deaf.
A source of constant heartache to me is our daily death toll on the highways. It is particularly distressing when you know it is avoidable. Last year we actually reduced our fatality rate when based on the number of cars on the road and miles traveled. But we also set an all-time high in deaths. In order to end the carnage on our roads, we must:
G. Expand the services of the Commission on Alcohol Problems by a substantially increased appropriation. With alcohol involved in 60% of the fatal accidents, we shall never make significant improvements in highway safety without attacking the alcohol problem.
H. Require all drivers to submit to an alcohol test when involved in a fatal accident.
I. Raise penalties for driving while intoxicated.

J. Expand number and jurisdiction of State Highway Patrol. The presence of a marked car increases the blood pressure and good judgment of every driver.
K. Require annual motor vehicle inspection. L. Require physical examination upon renewal of a driver's license.
No nation, no state can call itself humane if it does not use the resources within its power to put an end to human misery. 

Nor can a people claim for themselves a measure of greatness if they cannot build cities which serve man, cities which facilitate his commerce, elevate his culture and house his family. Minnesota can build great cities.
Of all the large metropolitan areas in the country, our seven-county area is one of the finest.
Its environment one of the most free from pollution, Its people one of the most highly educated, Its culture one of the most diverse, Its civic leadership one of the most productive. With such a foundation, we have no reason not to develop the outstanding metropolitan area in the country. But there is much to be done much to be done this Session. The urgency is real. By the year 2000, the population of the seven-county area will more than double. What you decide this Session will have a profound effect on whether at the turn of the century our cities will be disintegrating or thriving. Last Session, you created a Metropolitan Council whose potential to bring order to the urban scene has drawn international attention. During this Session, we must make the Metropolitan Council a viable instrument for problem solving. I urge your thorough consideration of:
A. Granting the Metropolitan Council operating authority over sewage treatment facilities. This item has the highest priority.
B. Making the Transit Commission accountable to the Metropolitan Council.
C. Strengthening the Metropolitan Council's voice in highway planning. D. Placing in the Metropolitan Council powers to effectively plan for and oversee the disposal of solid waste. E. Giving the Metropolitan Council planning and operating authority over a metropolitan zoo. Our Twin City area should be completely major league in its educational and recreational possibilities. Furthermore, it is incumbent upon us to whom falls the burden of decisionmaking to lift our sights beyond tomorrow. As we have been taught by the prophets of old, "Where there is no vision, the people perish." Especially is that fate sealed if we take no steps to prevent 90% of our population from living on 1% of the land. Entirely new cities must be built. Minnesota is already a frontrunner in the new cities concept. There is generous support of the Experimental City project which has now been renamed "The Minnesota City." You will be asked to support this project during this Session. I ask you to give it your serious attention. 

Another problem of great concern to our people is jobs. "Of all the ways society serves the individual, few are more meaningful than to provide him with a decent job. ,,1 And a safe job. We score well in providing decent jobs. In fact, we anticipate that when official figures for 1968 are published, for the first time in over 25 years Minnesotans' personal income will meet or exceed the national average. However, we have been tragically weak in developing safe jobs. Despite our appalling number of disabling injuries from auto accidents, more people are disabled at work than on the road. I give my wholehearted support to improving occupational safety. We should:
A. Increase the number of safety inspectors and their appropriation for travel.
B. Stiffen the penalties for violations of safety regulations from a misdemeanor to a gross misdemeanor.
c. Provide a procedure for public participation in the formulation
of safety standards. But we need to do more than improve the safety in jobs. We need to
continue to generate additional job opportunities. Therefore, we must encourage economic development throughout the entire state.
Please consider five important suggestions which can help us expand economic opportunity:
D. Substantially increase our financial commitment to both industrial and tourism regional programs. The record setting economic growth of the State over the past two years is eloquent testimony to the potential of regional problem solving. In the last two years, there was a 22% increase in tourism.
The impact of our Rural Renaissance Program is already paying dividends in our communities. For example, comparing September, 1968, nonagricultural employment with September, 1966, communities around the State show significant increases: Thief River Falls - 39%, Marshall - 27%, Little Falls - 15%, Crookston - 13%, Owatonna - 11%, and WilLmar - 10%.
E. Adopt a uniform Monday holiday law, with significant personal,
as well as economic advantages. I F. Remove the present 5¢ per capita limit that a county can spend
for promotional purposes.
G. Remove the five-year spread and the One Hundred Million Dollar bonding program adopted last Session to allow us to accelerate the construction
of safer roads. Particularly is this desirable in view of the federal cutback of Sixty-two Million Dollars which has disrupted our highway planning.
H. Intensify our agricultural development. The fate of the State is
bound up on the fate of the farmer and the farmer is in trouble. During the past ten years the farmer's labor costs have risen
46%, his machinery costs 30%, his debt interest 59% and the parity ratio I dropped to 74%, the lowest rate since the depression.
Granted, States' powers in agricultural policy and price supports
are severely limited. But I am convinced there is a role states can play. I shall call in April a Governor's Farm Conference so farmers can help us search
out state-based agricultural efforts. The Governor's Conference on Rural I Community Development and the Governor's Conference on Tourism were the authors
of several proposals in this speech. I look forward to the brainstorming in
April. These eight proposals should greatly increase our ability to author decent
and safe jobs. 
Neither can we overlook a topic of special significance to me, to you, and to all Minnesotans. It is an issue which intimately affects every man and
directly tests our basic principles. It is the question of human rights.
Two years ago we recognized the vital importance of this concern and you
created the nation's first Department of Human Rights. You passed a fair
housing law. The Department formed almost 50 local human rights councils
and handled over 450 cases of discrimination. We worked to actively invite
minority families to Minnesota's vacation spots, I issued the first Executive
Order banning discrimination in State business, the Department of Employment
Security put local offices in Negro neighborhoods and on Indian reservations,
and 36,000 permanent and temporary summer jobs for youth were found in 1968.
Those are good strides but not good enough. I have already assigned a man to start recruiting summer job opportunities for youth for the summer of
1969.
A. Furthermore, I urge the creation and funding of a Governor's
Councilor Committee on Youth Opportunity within the Division of Social
Services, with a full time director to work with the President's Council on Youth Opportunity at the State level, to initiate and coordinate a truly
comprehensive annual summer program for disadvantaged Minnesota youth in such
areas as employment, education, cultural endeavors and recreation involving
all of State Government, and enlisting the aid of local government, industry I and private groups.
B. In addition, in my budget message I shall recommend expanding
the capabilities of the Department of Human Rights through significantly
increased appropriations.
This governmental effort, coupled with private actions and a personal I

- 19 -
resolve, can help maintain Minnesota's national leadership in securing individual equality.

Many proposals have been made in this speech. Many more shall come in

special messages and informal conferences. However, in order to bring focus

to the mass of legislation we will consider in the next five months, I want to

underscore 11 areas where I feel legislation is a must if we are to convince

people of the governmental institution's ability to respond to change.

1. Major crime legislation.

2. Major reorganization legislation.

3. Minnesota's Crystal Waters Program.

4. Financial relief for Senior Citizens.

There are few subjects on which I receive as much mail as on the

sincere complaints of Senior Citizens that they cannot afford to stay in their

own homes. In over 20 hearings conducted around the State by the Governor's

Council on Aging, this fact was emphasized. The special real estate tax relief

intended for Senior Citizens last Session was largely lost. We must, in this

Session, make it effectual.

5. Undergirding quality education.

6. Forceful highway and occupational safety legislation.

7. Expanded powers for the Metropolitan Council.

8. Creation of a drug education center and a narcotics enforcement

division.

9. Expanded community care for the mentally retarded and mentally

10. Expanded job opportunities.

- 20 -
11. A constitutional amendment to lower the voting age. The reasons to do so are well known and will be drawn to your attention by a bipartisan group of young people called the Minnesota Coalition for Lowering the Voting Age. I was pleased last week to have a visit with this exciting group of young people and I enthusiastically support their efforts. I know you will enjoy working with them.
It is time to quit preaching at the young to become interested while blocking them from becoming involved. Let us let them in.


This is a program that will enable us to step out boldly and creatively
in Phase II of the Decade of Decision. These are the years that will determine if states can solve problems, if people can once again believe in the institution of government.
And I want more than anything else to reaffirm the State's ability to solve problems and to rebuild our people's trust in that ability. I seek no higher honor than to be called simply a problem solver.
sincerely look forward to the next five months when we shall prove to the people that we can meet the problems we have inherited from the past. We can tackle the problems of the present and we will earnestly seek to anticipate and avoid the problems of the future.
might add, perhaps I would not be so sure of government's ability if I did not see the determination, judgment and imagination reflected in this Chamber. To those of you who come to your desk for the first time, Congratulations on having been chosen to represent many Minnesotans and best wishes in

this serious but stimulating responsibility.
To all of you, my door is open. I welcome your frequent visits, for our close cooperation will be most necessary.
would be remiss if I did not also say thank you to the people of Minnesota. I am sincerely grateful for the tremendous degree of citizen participation on many boards, councils, task forces, study groups and commissions. Of the hundreds of people I have asked to serve, rarely has anyone declined.
Thanks also should go to all the good people of our State who have contributed to making Minnesota second in the nation as the Quality of Life State. We are justly proud of that achievement.
In 1969, "The problems never looked tougher and the prospects never looked brighter and anyone who isn't stirred by both those statements is frankly too tired to be of much use to us in the days ahead."l
This is a time of opportunity, not despair. A time of challenge, not defeat. In the words of William Faulkner when he accepted the Nobel Peace Prize for Literature:
"I decline to accept the end of man. I believe that man will not merely endure, he will prevail. He is immortal not because he alone among the creatures has an inexhaustible voice, but because he has a soul, a spirit capable of compassion, of sacrifice and endurance."Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, Members of the 68th Session of the Minnesota Legislature, Members of the Supreme Court, Constitutional Officers, and fellow citizens of Minnesota:
The last session of this Legislature accomplished a landmark in Minnesota history -- the most basic tax reform in many decades.
This session of the Legislature must do even more. It is our unique mandate to extend the spirit-and energy of reform to government itself.
Two years ago we set out to make state government "more responsive to our people and more imaginative in the service of their needs."
To extend that responsiveness, to enlarge our imagination, is the task before this session. 


Responsiveness must be built upon a new openness in government, an openness beyond any we have known before.
I congratulate you on your own unprecedented efforts toward this goal.
As the first business of this session you are opening doors that until now have been not only closed, but locked.

You are providing for: Fair minority representation. More open committee meetings. More recorded, public votes. More public access to records of your sessions, and all the rest. Those of you who fought for and won these essential reforms should know this; that thanks to you, no one will ever dare to turn back the clock again. But this is just the beginning. We must open up the rest of our governmental and political processes as well. The agenda is long, because for far too long it was ignored. Since 1913, the people of this state have had to wear blindfolds in the voting booth. This session of the Legislature is going to take those blindfolds off! Because our first step must be party designation for all those seeking election to the Minnesota Legislature. The urgency and importance of this measure can be suggested by this comment: If you pass the party designation bill by noon tomorrow, I will sign it before you leave the Capitol that evening. But party designation is only one of our imperatives.


Everyone of us who has ever campaigned knows that there is a deadly cancer infecting our free election system -- the way we are forced to finance our political campaigns.
Open government requires a tough, practical, enforceable disclosure of campaign contributions, and it must be passed this session.
Even disclosure laws, though, are only a very partial solution to the real plague on all our houses.
I have served in state government for 14 years, as a House member, a Senate member, and Governor. I receive great satisfaction from public service, and so do you. I believe in meeting the jury of our citizens in election campaigns" and so do you.
But the traditional way of soliciting campaign money sickens and alienates the public and undermines the very fabric of our institutions.
The late Adlai Stevenson said: "I doubt that it's possible to be elected President .. and deserve the office."
Secretary of Agriculture Earl Butz put it another way:
"Find a Congressman's financial angel. That's the way I worked to beat a bill raising price supports. I called up one chap and started to explain the bill. He said 'Don't bother. I'll just tell the Congressman I don't want it.' He did. That was it."

Every campaign sees the Democrats criticizing the Republicans for outrageous methods of procuring large contributions, and the Republicans accusing the Democrats of precisely the same thing.
Both sides are right, and both sides are guilty. So when some try to make this a partisan issue -- they're fooling no one.
If we really are serious about putting an end to special interest contributions, then the answer isn't merely disclosure or limitations on spending'. It is something much more fundamental.
The only way to really clean up the financing of political campaigns is to provide a method to finance campaigns by hundreds and thousands of small contributors.
And there is only one way to achieve that in the near future. We must give each taxpayer an opportunity to contribute to the party and candidates of his choice.
I recommend that the 1973 Legislature provide for a $1.00 check-off on the state income tax, just as the Congress and the President have attempted to meet this problem at the national level.
This does not mean that the taxpayer would add a dollar when he pays his tax bill. It means that one of the tax dollars he is already paying would be assigned to public financing of election campaigns -- if the taxpayer so chooses.


We would not be forcing anyone to contribute, but we would be providing Minnesota citizens the opportunity to help end a practice that taints us all.
We cannot guarantee that this plan will work perfectly, but if openness and honesty and integrity are to be more than fine words, then we had better try.
We must continue these reform efforts until any American can run for office in this country without losing either his shirt, his self-respect, or his independence -or all three.
To turn, for a moment, to another legislative problem:
We all know the long, complicated, expensive story of legislative reapportionment in 1971. We failed. The Federal Courts, not state officials, finally reapportioned our Legislature -- and barely in time.
We did redistrict the Congressional seats. And we did what we usually do when we redistrict. We protected the incumbents. In fact, we gave six of them even safer seats -- which took some doing. That's wrong. That's not open government. That doesn't give the people the chance to change things. I believe a candidate from either party ought to have at least a fighting chance to win. We made this more difficult -- perhaps impossible.

And that's what we will do again unless we find a new way to reapportion and redistrict.
I propose a Constitutional Amendment to take Legislative and Congressional reapportionment out of the hands of the Legislature and assign it to a bi-partisan commission, as recommended by the Constitutional Study Commission.
I fully support this top priority recommendation of the Commission.
I also support another legislative ,reform. Two years ago I recommended that the Legislature cut its size effective after the 1980 census, if a reduction could not be accomplished in the reapportionment process. I still support such a measure, and I hope the 1973 Legislature will pass it. Our citizens also deserve better opportunities to vote. In the 1972 campaign in Minnesota, several hundred thousand potential voters failed to register, in spite of a vigorous bi-partisan- registration effort. This Legislature must give serious consideration to a system which permits a voter to register on election day if he has not already done so. Voting is a right and not a privilege. We must insure the people access to that fundamental right.

I do not need to inform the members of this Legislature that perhaps the best way to open a unit of government to the people is to require that its members be elected. Accordingly, I strongly recommend that this session of the Legislature transform the Metropolitan Council potentially the most innovative force in our largest urban area -- from an appointive to an elective body.

As a result, we are faced today with a conflict in metropolitan government, a vagueness over lines of authority, an impasse over how decisions should be made that affect directly the lives of half the people of this state. Today's indecision is the price of yesterday's neglect. The failure to fully define and anticipate the role of metropolitan government is becoming clearer each day.
I am convinced that history will show our efforts at metropolitan government to be among the most significant innovations ever begun by a State Legislature. Our response must recognize that significance.
I ask this session to give major priority of time and attention to metropolitan .government, to establishing clearly its authority and framework. We must treat this as a necessity, not an afterthought.
We also need to open up the executive branch of state government.
Perhaps the greatest strength of our system is that elected officials are held strictly accountable for the performance of their administrations.
What concerns me is that I want to hold our key state department heads equally accountable for their departments and the responsibilities we place on them.

But that!s not really possible when we deny to some department heads, with thousands of employees, the right to choose their own management teams, of even 3 or 4. For example, we have an outstanding Commissioner of Highways with over 5,000 employees in his department and we do not permit him to select a single one when he takes office.
There is a danger that we have given the entrenched bureaucracy a veto over the elected representatives of the people.
That's wrong. We must change it. I will ask for appropriate changes in the laws to assure the responsiveness and accountability of our administrative leadership. Another method, long overdue, for opening and strengthening state government is to place more representatives of the public on policy boards and commissions. We can increase the size of boards where necessary to make room for public members. Finally, the people's right to know is not guaranteed by the openness of government alone. These times also demand that we take steps in Minnesota to protect reporters from intimidation by government in carrying on their legitimate work.

A number of newsmen are now in jail around the country for refusing to reveal confidential sources. I regret that the pressure seems to be increasing.
Reporters are being prosecuted not because they are irresponsible, but precisely because they have been responsible to their basic function of publishing the truth.
Everyone in public life occasionally disagrees with some article or coverage. But government officials who fear the press, and seek to suppress it, are very short-sighted indeed. For our system of government itself would die without the freedom of speech and freedom of the press guaranteed us in the First Amendment.
Several states now have laws that shield reporters from revealing confidential sources of information. I recommend the passage of such a bill by this Legislature.
I hope that these recommendations for open government will be acted upon by the Legislature. And I hope you will go on from there to carry out the spirit of openness with which this session has begun.
And now, let us turn to the value that our people receive from their tax dollars.
The last session of the Legislature was known for its successful attempt to bring justice to our state tax system. This session must become known for bringing justice to the spending of those tax dollars.


Many Minnesotans believe there is waste and inefficiency in state government. The major reason they believe so is that there is waste and inefficiency in our state government.
For example, more than 3,000 dormitory beds are empty across the public college campuses of our state.
They are empty because of poor planning. The State of Minnesota built more dormitories than it needs. The people of Minnesota are paying the price and will continue to pay it for a long time to come.
We know that more and more elementary school classrooms are standing empty -- not ancient, decrepit buildings for the most part, but relatively recent facilities built at considerable cost to the taxpayers of those districts.
In one of our state departments, there are three vehicles for each employee -- and the grass grows high around some of those vehicles.
One of our state college campuses, the newest facility in the system, stands with twice as many classrooms as it needs. Present projections are that many or most of those classrooms will never be needed on that campus.
Some major and expensive mistakes have been made. They were not deliberate. Many of us here helped make them.

But they wasted state tax dollars. And wasted dollars do not serve human needs. Every wasted dollar, every short-range commitment that comes back to haunt us with long-range consequences, deprives the people of the state of funds
that could go to meet urgent human needs.
The need for economy in state government has never been so clear. The sick and the handicapped and the helpless will be properly served only when first-rate, tough, hard planning and management are required of every department and agency in this state. We can no longer tolerate a situation where Chambers of Commerce in the communities of our state are pitted against one another in a desperate effort to lobby for short-range advantages, and state pOlicy becomes a matter of who wins the battle.
This was the old way of doing things. We cannot afford it, now or ever again.
That is why I am so pleased with the success of one of the most remarkable projects ever undertaken in state government.
The State of Minnesota is a large and complex enterprise with a multi-billion dollar budget. If we were listed on the Fortune magazine list of 500 largest corporations in the nation, we would be 37th from the top.


with this in mind we asked Minnesota's businessmen to share their expertise with the state. We wanted the state to adopt the best most modern business procedures and techniques, wherever possible.
The response from the business community was overwhelming.
Since June, the Loaned Executives Action Program, known as L.E.A.P., has provided the state with a staff of 74 full-time and 26 part-time people, representing 50 of the top corporations in the state. Under the capable direction of Douglas Dayton, they have devoted the equivalent of 26 man-years to the examination of our state government at no expense to the state.
They sent us their best. We are now receiving 139 separate, far-reaching reports on our various agencies and departments. L.E.A.P.'s summary report will be published in the next few days. I was surprised, and pleased, and very, very grateful to the Minnesota business community for its toughness and candor. Let me" assure you that they did not tell us only those things they thought we wanted to hear. Now we have the job of following through. We must continue to keep the pressure on every state department and on ourselves. The dollars we save will serve the people of our state.

The L.E.A.P. report also includes legislative recommendations. They will be forwarded to you during the coming weeks as we are able to prepare and refine them, and I hope you will give them earnest consideration.
And may I state my strong hope that other units of government will seek the counsel and management capabilities of our business community too. There is no unit of government that cannot greatly improve its effectiveness through such cooperation. I include, most specifically, our local school boards, who are responsible for spending a very major portion of the revenues which are raised within the state.
Two major L.E.A.P. recommendations for reorganizing the central administration of state government will be among my legislative requests -- the centralizing of our state personnel administration and the strengthening of our budgeting, finance, and auditing processes. These steps are extremely important to real economy in our state government.
And I will make one other major legislative request to improve our state government as well.
In part, the respect and esteem we have for the people of our state and their government can be measured by the priority and concern we give to attracting the most talented, the best trained, the best equipped people to state service. That is how we provide the kind of state service our people deserve.
But our state government finds it very difficult to compete for those people.

When I assumed office, I knew that we were not competitive with private business and school districts. But I was alarmed to discover that the state could not compete with county and city governments for comparable talent.
The problem is not just salaries. In a recent survey of retirement benefits for 41 states, for employees with 20 years of service, Minnesota ranked 39th from the top. We were ahead of Nebraska and South Dakota, and behind everybody else. For retirees with 30 years of service, we were not much better -- 36th of the 41 states in the survey. What does this mean? It means that it is very difficult to attract the best qualified men and women to state government, no matter how dedicated they are. And it means that people who devote their lives to our state government receive almost nothing in return. A psychiatric technician at one of our state hospitals, with 20 years of devotion to the mentally ill, can retire with $107 a month under our present retirement program. A highway technician, with 20 years of service, retires at the handsome rate of $101 per month. A senior highway maintenance worker, with 32 years of state service, receives just $213 a month.

.A Senior Division Head, one of our top management employees, with 46 years service, earns just $5,600 a year in retirement benefits. After 46 years. And that's at the top of our scale.
Our mandatory retirement age is 70 for the state retirement system. Few retire any earlier. They simply can't afford it.
And just as with any other employee, the retirement age for custody officers in our corrections system is also 70, with poor retirement benefits.
The present system insures that people 68 and 69 years old must deal with prisoners and the criminally insane who are half their age and several times their strength.
Too old to perform the job as it should be performed, unwilling to retire to a humiliating pension, they keep on -- as well as they can.
This is the most appalling, the most dangerous waste in state government that I know.
There is only one answer. We must improve our retirement benefits. We must reduce the age for mandatory retirement to 65, and to age 55 for custody officers at our prisons and security hospitals and others whose lives and abilities are placed in jeopardy ..

Under this plan, between 1,500 to 1,800 employees would be able to retire by the end of the next biennium.
We can bring more than 150 young, strong, trained new employees into service for our corrections system alone.
My budget message will contain more specific information on this proposal.
With this retirement program, with careful review of all vacant positions, and with the recommendations on complement that I will make in my budget message, I am today setting the goal of trying to reduce "the number of Minnesota state employees by five percent by the end of the next biennium.
I believe that can be accomplished while improving the quality of services provided by the state.
With your help, an improved retirement program is another step we can take to provide real economy in state government. 

Neither open government nor economy in government is justified solely for its own sake.
But openness and economy will better equip us to meet the central purpose of government, which is to anticipate and meet human needs.
These needs are many and complex.

In the field of human rights, there are several steps that must be taken now.
Our first priority must be ratification of the Federal Equal Rights Amendment. I fully support and strongly encourage such action, as you know.
But $tate government should also lead the way in making employment and promotions available on a non-discriminatory basis to minorities and women. Our state has not led the way. We must catch up and move ahead. It is a necessary, basic human commitment.
Therefore, I will ask the Legislature to provide support for the state Affirmative Action Program instituted this Fall by Executive Order.
I will also ask the Legislature to extend our anti-discrimination laws to cover the handicapped, and place this new responsibility in the Department of Human Rights.
With a proper opportunity to try, many of our handicapped citizens can become both productive and independent.
They deserve to be judged on their capability to do the work, yet they are often automatically excluded because of their handicaps. Placing them under the antidiscrimination laws is a necessary first step to opportunity.

Another significant step this Legislature must take is to lower the age of majority to 18 years in Minnesota.
Our laws clearly discriminate against 18 to 20 year old citizens. We have already given these citizens the right to vote by amendment of the Federal Constitution. With that amendment we extended to them the most precious right that can be exercised. It would be hypocritical now to attempt to deny these young people their other rights as well, including the right to hold public office.
The needs of the average workingmen and women of Minnesota constitute a very major order of unfinished business that awaits resolution by this session of the Legislature.
This Legislature should pass a state minimum wage law tied to the Federal Minimum Wage which will reflect all future federal increases. The current $1.75 per hour Federal Minimum Wage should be provided for all full time workers. Time and one-half should be provided for all hours worked in excess of forty hours a week.
We must also increase Unemployment Compensation benefits. Increases should reflect the earning level of the worker.

Our law now provides a weekly benefit equal to fifty percent of the average weekly wage of the worker, subject to a maximum of $64. Thus, regardless of how high an individual's earnings may have been, he cannot collect a weekly benefit in excess of $64.
I recommend that the maximum be changed from $64 to sixty percent of the average weekly wage paid in Minnesota in the preceding year.
Coverage should also be extended to include a number of farm workers. I recommend that agricultural employers who employ a total of four or more workers for twenty or more weeks should be required to provide benefits.
We should also extend Unemployment Compensation benefits to workers who are put out of work by labor disputes in which they are not participants.
Along with adequate wages and benefits, I am equally concerned that working conditions be as safe and as healthy as possible. The new Federal Occupational Safety and Health Act is an important tool to help us achieve these ends.
My Budget will contain requests for state matching funds to permit implementation of OSHA in Minnesota as quickly as possible so that Minnesota's work force may derive maximum benefit.

Workers who are injured on the job should be guaranteed maximum allowable Workmen's Compensation. We need to integrate our benefits with the new disability provisions under the Social Security Act.
We intend to continue to scrutinize carefully how our state programs can be coordinated with federal programs to maximize benefits for all Minnesota workers.
Fair treatment for Minnesota's workers will also require revision of the Public Employees Labor Relations Act.
A means must be provided to settle impasse situations.
I recommend that the Act be amended to provide for voluntary binding arbitration.
The Act should also be clarified to distinguish between supervisory and non-supervisory personnel.
And no consideration of human needs in Minnesota can omit the very real and growing threat to our family farmers.
In California, 45 conglomerates own 61 percent of all the farm land in the state.
I don't want that to happen here. These figures reflect a major threat to the quality of life of any state. We can still protect our family farms by passing the Family Farm Act of 1973 which will restrict the right of conglomerates and huge foreign corporations to penetrate and take over our family farm system in Minnesota.

I have also signed an Executive Order creating a Rural Development Council, as I indicated I would a few weeks ago.
This Council will be instrumental, I predict, in organizing the resources of state government to focus on the needs of outstate Minnesotans.
Our Vietnam veterans also deserve our help. They served bravely in a war that they should not have had to fight at all. I know we share the commitment made by our voters last November to provide a Vietnam Bonus.
In my Budget Message two weeks from now, I will identify additional legislative priorities.
That Message will deal in detail with education, corrections, welfare, the environment, and the other basic issues confronting our people.
I stated at the outset of this Message that this session of the Legislature is faced with a mandate unique in Minnesota history. I know that you can meet and fulfill that mandate, for this session is itself unique in the annals of our Legislature.
This uniqueness goes beyond even the unprecedented alignment of the caucuses. It goes beyond partisan allegiance and relates more fundamentally to the kind of men and women who now serve in both our Houses.

I don't believe that any session of our Minnesota Legislature has ever been composed of as high a percentage of new members as this one. I don't believe that any session has been as youthful. I know that no other session has had as many women members.
This newness, this freshness provides us with a special opportunity to demonstrate to the people of Minnesota that "Government works ... and it works for them."
That is what this session is uniquely qualified to do,. To fail would be tragic, to succeed would be to found a whole new era in our public life.
So let us begin this historic session knowing that the only restraints on progress are timidity and doubt. Let our vision be worthy of our mandate. Let each horizon become a threshold.
Let this be a session in which government does work for the people. Starting now.
Thank you.

Mr. Speaker Mr. President members of the minnesota legislature judges of the minnesota supreme court distinguished guests and fellow citizens of minnesota:
Yesterday you reconvened for the final weeks of the 68th legislative session that began more than a year ago.
This is not the beginning of your deliberations.
Nor will they end in these few weeks. For the work you take up again today is the continuation of anew approach to the legislative process in minnesota a recognition that responsive government requires our constant attention.

you are not assembled here after months of rest} but after months of hard work.
The times demand that kind of devotion.
It would be easy to be discouraged today} for this is a dark and frustrating time.
Many americans are pessimistic. Many americans are losing faith--not just in government} but in nearly all the institutions of our economic and political system.
That is not difficult to understand. For most} it is a struggle just to meet the payroll} or pay all the bills and make ends meet. Nine out of ten americans believe they will be worse off next year than they are now.
They do not believe government--or any institution--will help.
Still in the aftermath of a senseless war} they now see the blatant misuse of power in our national public life.

it is tempting to call this crisis national-for it is. But we dare not use that fact as an excuse. We must not evade our own responsibility or squander our opportunity to help the nation find its way.
So the question before us today is what we can do in minnesota in these final legislative weeks to address these problems and to bring back confidence. That question comes at a time when we are faced by the most frustrating single element of the crisis
our overpowering concern continues,to be the shortage of energy.
We still lack basic information that we know we can rely on.
The facts seem to change almost every day on any part of the problem you might ask about.
After.All this time the magnitude of the problem ranges from zero to disaster depending on who is describing it at the moment.
Congressman john zwach expressed the frustration of all of us when he said last week:
Hi get as many conflicting reports as anybody else. We have to rely too much on oil companies. I think they tell us what they want to tell."

our federal energy coordinator bill simon has ordered a federal audit of supply information among the oil companies. It is the only way he says to find out the truth about supplies and price increases.
Two weeks ago in the new york times anthony lewis felt the crisis was so critical that he called for a program to put all our motorists on buses and bicycles.
But on the very same page of the same newspaper on the same day christopher rand said there was no crisis at all plenty of energy for everybody. His article was headlined "oil oil everywhere."
as we address the energy priority in this legislative session there are no proven model programs for states to install. But we do know several truths here in minnesota.
We have been incredibly wasteful as individuals and a nation.
With six percent of the world's population we consume more than a third of the world's energy each year'.
There is another truth: Our american love affair with the automobile has starved mass transit . Blinded us while the railroads abandoned this country and crippled intercity bus service.

we are overly dependent on the automobile. In this state there are nearly two automobiles in operation for each family.
Too many drive cars when it's not necessary. Too many students drive short distances to school. Too many people still choose to drive alone.
But even these truths are not the whole story. Our crisis is not due to waste alone.
During november of 1972approximately 177 million gallons of gasoline and 133 million gallons of heating oil were sold in minnesota. One year later in november of 1973 the number of gallons sold was just about the same.
But not the price per gallon. That was up -50 percent for heating oil and 30 percent for gasoline. And those prices are still rising.
Last year 1200 service stations closed their doors. Ladies and gentlemen that's 1200 in minnesota not america. Almost all small independent businessmen.
But not everybody has been suffering. The profits of the major international oil companies for just the third quarter of 1973 alone were up as much . As 91 percent over the year before.

so profits are up and competition is down. I don't believe that was done to help us through the winter.
That is another truth we know.
We also know that some will try to use the energy shortage as an excuse to abandon our effort to provide a cleaner environment for our children.
That is not the answer. And we will not let it happen.
One further truth: Our people have already shown that they are willing to help and sacrifice-if it's really needed and everybody does it together.
These are all facts we rely upon.
And so our goals in minnesota are clear and essential:
It is our job as astate to protect our " people with all the strength we have.
It is our job to keep our people working and our farmers farming.
It is our job to preserve the ability of industry and small business to support a strong minnesota economy.

and it is our job as astate to pay more thoughtful attention to the future to stop waste and maintain the fragile energy balance that supports our prosperity and our quality of life.
We need information. We need to make ourselves heard in washington. We need to develop a state energy policy.
And to achieve those things we have nowhere to turn but to ourselves.
That is why i. Re-emphasize my support today for the creation of a department of energy as provided in legislation authored by representative willard munger and senators alec olson and win borden. I am grateful for the leadership they are providing.
We need a strong visible permanent agency to develop information and recommend policy. We must give it some authority over the growth and conservation of energy supplies in our state. It must draw together . The expert knowledge and efforts of all our great public and private institutions.
I urge the passage of this legislation. We must get on with the job.

we must also respond to the federal legislation requiring speed limits that do not exceed 55 miles per hour on our state highways. And as more federal requirements are seti we have a continuing responsibility to cooperate.
It is also essential to give our school districts the flexibility they need to adjust to energy conservation practices and meet shortages that may develop. And we need to clarify the authority of our state executive council to deal with emergencies.
Finally we must take direct steps to reduce our excessive reliance on the automobile.
We must get people out of automobiles.
But that means getting as many people as possible into community transit systems not only in the twin cities metropolitan area but all across the state.
We cannot accomplish that in a single week. But we cannot accomplish it at all without providing more state support.'
the basic issue is,whether we should use state funds to improve public transportation.

only 54 percent of minnesota's population is concentrated in the 13 communities with mass transit systems. The other 46 percent do not have such transportation available to them.
Now why should senator roger moe from ada or dick fitzsimons from argyle or representative neil haugerud from way down in preston support state funds for transit for city folks?
Their people are not served by community transit. Some would argue that their districts will not benefit.
But it will. I'll tell you why.
Because you want those city drivers to stop using their cars.
If you want to convince a driver in st. Paul or st. Cloud or rochester or moorhead or mankato or duluth to take the bus to work or school or just downtown there must be service that is inexpensive} convenient and comfortable.
That's not the way it is today.

you can't expect people to give up their cars to ride on buses that haven't been built. Along routes that don't exist: Take trains that are no longer in service on roadbeds that are no longer safe.
And so they drive their cars.
Every gallon of gasoline they use in those cars is not available for your tractors farm implements and trucks to plant and cultivate the crops and take the harvest to market.
It is a gallon of gasoline that wasn't saved for a trip to a minnesota resort community.
It is a gallon of gasoline that can't be used to bring merchandise to a small-town minnesota store.
But if we don't use that gasoline in our cars there's a better chance it will be there for farms and factories and businesses.
That is why i urge you to provide $6 million of state funds to improve community transit operations throughout minnesota and explore the possibility of developing them here they do not exist.

this strong commitment to improving community transit operations is a major step we can take in this session to change the way we live in a society where energy conservation is absolutely essential.
Not just for this winter or the next eighteen months. But for the foreseeable future.
In addition i am recommending once again that you give final approval to senator alec olson and representative irv anderson's $200 million highway and transit bonding bill. It not only provides $80 million for community transit: It also provides $120 million to help upgrade unsafe rural highways.
There are no magic buttons for state governments to press. If we do all of these things the energy crisis will not disappear.
But they are a necessary start and now is the time to begin.

the shortage of energy is frustrating and inconvenient and threatening. But it is also an opportunity to improve" the real standards of our living} to strengthen the pattern of our lives.
I know how difficult it may be in the months and years ahead. But in the long run} we will be a stronger state and nation and a better people as a result of facing up to the energy crisis.
We will be less wasteful and more saving.
The quality of our environment will improve.
We have another commitment to keep before this session ends.
Everyone has been saddened and embarrassed by the revelations of arrogance and illegal activity on the national level that have broken over us during the past months.
No other development has been so responsible for undermining our faith.
Everyone in this chamber--from whatever political persuasion--has been cheated by these events.

everyone here knows that we cannot cast aside their implications.
To the people of this state who are listening to us today i want to emphasize this point.
We have all read a great deal about this national tragedy. But i have been in politics and government for more than sixteen years.
And i know the minnesota republican party is not like that. The minnesota democratic-farmer-labor is not like that.
The men and women who participate in politics in political parties and in government in minnesota are not like that.
Minnesota is not like that. Not in the past not in the present and god willing never in the future.
But we have been flirting with disaster for years in minnesota as well as the nation.
For as i said here a year ago) the way we are forced to finance our election campaigns is a deadly cancer infecting our free election system.

this state of ours has produced more than its share of presidential candidates and national leaders in public life.
We are the nation's model in so many ways.
Now we must exert national leadership in reforming the election process as well.
That means realistic limits on campaign spending.
It means mandatory disclosure of contributions.
It means moving toward broad based public support through the $1.00 check off system.
It means a tough and impartial ethics commission to give the most careful attention to the supervision of elections and the political activities of elected office holders.
The legislation being carried by senators north and keefe and representative tom berg is before you.
No one claims it is perfect or that it should be exempt from reasonable debate.

but we do know that the major thrust of this legislation is both essential and overdue.
Its defeat would be intolerable.
The people of minnesota will not accept excuses. And they should not. There is too much at stake.
We must give our attention to other important legislation as well.
I have a prejudice.
I believe that pride in home ownership is one of the great strengths of our society. Home ownership supports the quality neighborhoods our children deserve.
Nearly 72 percent of our minnesota homes are owned by those who live in them.
People who own their homes have a stake in their neighborhoods and they know it.
Yet this cornerstone of our quality of life is being threatened. Ordinary citizens find it difficult and often impossible today to buy new homes or even improve the homes in which they are living. Federal assistance does not begin to meet this problem.

that is why two months ago senate majority leader coleman and house speaker sabo joined me in proposing anew housing rehabilitation program.
A large portion of our minnesota residences are in need of repair. The program we are urging you to pass will provide $100 million in revenue bonds for small housing improvement loans at low interest rates.
There is another important matter on which time is running out.
It was widely predicted last january that this would be the session in which no-fault insurance became law in minnesota. There is still time to do so.
And i very strongly urge you to make this prediction come true. We need no-fault insurance--we need a reduction in the premiums our people pay.
Another area that requires action this
year is metropolitan planning and development.
Let me express my gratitude for the great time and effort that has been given to questions of metropolitan government by this legislature since i noted a year ago that such attention was long overdue.

i am well aware that there are important legitimate differences on questions of substance---on metropolitan issues that still divide the senate and house committees.
Answers to such basic questions should not come easily. But they should come soon--and in the spirit of compromise that marks the governmental process.
Many of our metropolitan concerns require immediate attention.
We must find a way to help communities develop additional parks and open spaces before the spaces and the opportunity disappear.
And the energy crisis demands that this legislature commit itself to the preparation of a comprehensive metro transit plan to be reviewed and approved when you meet again in 1975.
In the end, effective action on these metropolitan questions will help to reassure our citizens that state government can respond to the common needs.

we should also establish an independent board for the selection of design architects and engineers for state projects as senator coleman and representative irv anderson are proposing.
We should insure the protection of parochial school tax credits that have already been granted and explore alternative ways of keeping a strong dual system of public and private education in our state.
Under the new federal income plan for the aged blind and disabled we should supplement payments for all who meet our previous state standards of eligibility
we need some immediate capacity plan the future shape of our human services system in minnesota.
We should consider a state program of low interest loans for community health and mental health facilities including group homes.
We should make certain that needy people do not suffer financial losses under the general assistance reforms provided in 1973.

we should consider state regulation of our minnesota utilities.
The list could be still longer. I know that you will give attention to many of these items and others on your own agendas.
But i ask you to concentrate on the priorities:
To act with deliberate speed and minimum partisanship.
I feel privileged to have worked with a legislature that dared so much and has already achieved so much.
It is tempting to list your record--the senior citizen tax freeze, help for the handicapped, environmental protection, the veterans bonus, significant consumer legislation, the minimum wage and public employee bargaining laws, restrictions on corporate farming, more openness in the conduct of government at all levels, maintenance of fair school finance and property tax relief.
Our business today is what you still must dol not what you have done.

our people appreciate the effort you have made.
For minnesotans are aware of what kind of state and what kind of people we are.
The real strength of our state springs from the talent1 energy and humane commitment of our people.
I am optimistic about our future.
Our people are resilient and responsive and realistic.
They can live with the truth.
They do not accept easy rhetoric and impossible promises. But they do recognize and support performance.
They have heard the warnings of these troubled days.
And so must we.

Dear Mr. Speaker, Mr. Majority Leader, and Members of the 69th Session of the Minnesota Legislature:
As you reconvene for the remaining weeks of the 69th Session of the Minnesota Legislature, your extensive interim activities have been well reported, and the substance of important legislation before you is well-known to all of us and to the people of Minnesota. For that reason, I have not asked for an opportunity to appear before you to deliver a formal State of the State message, as I did in 1974.
It is helpful to have available the Senate Majority Caucus list of priority concerns, and I am also pleased to have had the opportunity to discuss the coming session with the leadership of both houses. You can be certain that my office will cooperate with your wish for a brief session, including the deadlines for committee action established by the Legislative Coordinating Committee. Although the business before this session has' major significance for many of our people, I certainly agree with you that there is no need for a long session this year.
Before summarizing those legislative items that deserve attention, in my judgment, it seems desirable to report briefly on the state's financial condition at this time.
As you know, the Department of Finance and the Department of Revenue have reported that state revenue for the first six months of the current fiscal year was approximately $32 million
above the projections adopted by the Legislature in its 1975 budget

considerations, but an uncertain farm income picture raises the possibility that income tax revenues will fall $30 million to $40 million below estimates for the remaining months of the fiscal year.
Further information will become available next month for use by the Legislature. At this point, there is no reason to modify the Legislature's previous projections of state revenue available for the biennium. Overall Federal budgeting for the 1976-1977 fiscal year, including the prospects for general revenue-sharing, is still undetermined. The condition of the nation's economy remains uncertain for the same period. Projections for the second year of our budgeting period must therefore be considered uncertain.
Based on 1975 projections, we can look forward toa balanced state budget if we continue to monitor expenditures very carefully. The 1975 Legislature concluded its work with approximately $65 million of projected revenue remaining unspent, but with bills totalling approximately $63.5 million awaiting final passage.
Of these appropriations, the Legislative Advisory Commission, as you know, has anticipated immediate 1976 passage of H.F.l741, funding semi-state agencies, and has provided funds to the affected agencies on a contingency basis. Appropriation of approximately $9.6 million for that purpose will leave approximately $53.8 million of projected revenues for the biennium available for 1976 decisions.
That amount represents less than 1.2 percent of total projected revenues for the 1975-1977 biennium. Since Minnesota law provides that our budget must be balanced, our remaining resources are obviously very limited.
In addition to the semi-state appropriation, two other bills constitute items for priority action, in my judgment.
The first is H.F. 1199, providing approximately $7 million for drug and alcohol outreach and treatment. I support the proposed modification of this legislation that would use a portion of the funds to supplement 1975 appropriations for our state system of

The Honorable Martin Olav Sabo The Honorable Nicholas D. Coleman Page 3 January 21, 1976
local detoxification centers. There has been excellent and serious participation by chemical dependency specialists in government and private agencies in developing this legislation and recommending its outreach procedures. I urge its quick passage, with the modifications that have been developed.
The other major priority for 1976 action, in my jUdgment, is H.F. 1137, which provides approximately $40 million for additional efforts by our Minnesota Housing Finance Agency to make decent housing available where it is needed most. In my Inaugural and Budget addresses a year ago, I strongly recommended such legislation and I hope the Legislature will quickly approve this important improvement in our state housing program.
It is also vital to make two adjustments in existing legislation to meet problems that have become apparent since you met in 1975. Our state unemployment tax must be increased by one-tenth of one percent so that we continue to qualify for interest-free loans from the federal government until a recovering economy restores the level of our state unemployment compensation fund. And we must change a provision of the 1975 tax relief legislation that unintentionally disqualified senior citizens in subsidized housing from receiving property tax relief as renters.
Other important legislation now in final stages includes S.F. 919, to improve our environmental permit processes; S.F. 1308, to clear up a number of problems related to public water drainage in our state; H.F. 1206, establishing land use grants for local governments; and H.F. 645, establishing local community health programs in our state. Within the financial resources available, and considering other needs which may develop during the session, these measures deserve your continuing support .
. For five years, the legislative and executive branches have been working to bring together our fragmented transportation efforts under a Department of Transportation, and I hope that action can be completed this year if possible. The Legislature should also give serious consideration to a special state bonding program to provide much-needed repairs to the most seriously deteriorating highway bridges in our state, and I reiterate my support for up to $200 million of bonding for that purpose. We must face up to this need sooner or later.

Throughout your 1975 deliberations substantial committee attention has been devoted to the question of legislative, executive and judicial salaries in Minnesota. As you know, I have proposed that the Legislature create a special commission, like the one that is operating successfully in the state of Michigan, to establish these salaries with review by the Legislature. However, whether that structure is adopted or not, it is vital to reach consensus on salaries this year for all three branches of our state government, so that reasonable pay adjustments for state government service can be put into effect. Timing is especially critical for legislative compensation, since adjustments cannot be granted for members of the 1977-1978 Legislature unless they are acted upon this year.
As chairman of Minnesota's Bicentennial observance, the Lieutenant Governor of Minnesota will be proposing small state subsidies for Minnesota communities that undertake special Bicentennial observances. I recommend that an appropriate amount of state funds be provided for this purpose.
I also urge your favorable consideration of proposed legislation to establish a Legislative Commission on the Economic Status of Women.
Many other matters will be before you in the next few weeks, including possible action to help insure that our major league sports teams and our major league arts institutions will be available to our people; proposed energy conservation requirements; changes in our criminal sentencing procedures; the adequacy of our maximum security prison" facilities; the unfortunate availability of alcoholic beverages to high school students; the availability of bilingual and bicultural education for students who have difficulty with the English language; revisions of our laws governing nursing home regulation; railroad improvements, and metropolitan land use planning, among others. Thoughtful attention has been given to these issues during interim meetings of legislative committees. They deserve your continued attention and action if time permits.
The wisdom of our flexible session arrangement is demonstrated by the opportunity it gives us this year to devote additional and thoughtful legislative and executive consideration to matters of significance to the people of Minnesota. The Legislature appears

well-prepared for the remaining weeks of the session. The major issues that require attention are relatively few, but we are fortunate to have the opportunity to address them now.
My office and my staff will continue to be available to provide information and assistance as the members of the Legislature desire. We join you in anticipating a brief but productive completion of the agenda of the 69th Session of the Minnesota State Legislature.
With warmest regards.
Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Court, Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, Members of the 70th Session of the Minnesota Legislature, fellow constitutional officers, distinguished guests, and fellow citizens:

This is the beginning of my eighth full day as Governor of Minnesota. It's my first opportunity to appear before you.

Some of you have been my friends and colleagues in Minnesota state government for as long as fourteen years.

You have shared the burden--and satisfaction--of making this the most progressive and successful state in the union.

To those of you who are here for the first time, as new members of this outstanding Legislative body, I say "Welcome".

To the veteran Legislators in this Assembly, and to your 1eaders, I say "Well done".

This is the hardest working, most productive Legislature in the nation. And in terms of records of accomplishments, it is one of the most underpaid.


As one with a deep interest in Minnesota history I can tell you today that we have never had a Governor who has accomplished more than Wendell Anderson.

And we never had a Legislature that made as big a mark on the life of Minnesota people as you have made in the past four years.

It is now our challenge to continue that remarkable record.

I'm not here today to layout a detailed Legislative program or budget. We will be back in this Chamber in twenty days to begin that task. Today I simply want to tell you how I feel about Minnesota, our government and our people.

This nation has just ended its Bicentennial year. It is not a conclusion, it is just a beginning.

In this first year of America's third century it is time to look ahead to what the future holds for the people of our state. I know our people and I am optimistic.

As Minnesota's chairman of the Bicentennial I have traveled to more Minnesota communities and met more Minnesota citizens than any other elected official in our 119-year history. They have taught me the meaning of the Minnesota spirit.

The people of this state are an inexhaustible resource of faith and optimism! pride and high expectations. They try hard. They work hard. They look forward to better lives for themselves! their children! and to those who haven't been so fortunate.
Our people are committed to education and to opportunity. They believe you can succeed if you work at it.
They know Minnesota is not perfect. But they think we do better than just about anybody else. They are proud of the Minnesota effort to build and maintain a high quality of life. They support the Minnesota partnership for progress--with personal effort and the hard cash of their tax dollars. And they expect their leaders to live up to their promises and live up to their ability. We can do that and now is the time to begin.
Minnesota is just emerging from a damaging national recession. Our economy has done better than the nation's. Our unemployment is far below the national average. Our state budget is balanced. And our state credit is good.
But too many Minnesota workers still do not have jobs. And a savage unrelenting drought has struck a tragic blow to farm families! the communities! and our vital farm economy.
Raging forest fires have severely damaged our important timber! resort and outdoor recreational industries.

The most important thing we have to do this year is to put people back to work. 

And we can do that.

First, through an even stronger state housing effort, to create productive jobs for construction workers and help people find decent places to 1ive.

Second, through the Governor's Task Force on drought aid
we established last week, to bring state and federal resources to
bear on the immediate problems of our farmers.

Third, through using special resources to provide temporary work for farm families and others in need of help.

Today I am announcing a special $2 million work program for hard-pressed farm families in our worst drought areas. We will use federal funds from the 1976 Public Works Employment Act. We will offer public service jobs for up to 15 weeks at prevailing wages. The Governor1s Manpower Office and the State Department of Agriculture will put this program into operation this week.

These are not state government jobs. They will not affect our state budget. But they are a responsible and productive way to make use of federal help.

These temporary jobs will help our farm area families who are suffering the most. They will help farmers through the winter to spring planting time. And that is what we must do.

Fourth, we can, and must, do much more to develop good economic information and sound economic planning in Minnesota. In the long run, that is how we can insure permanent jobs and stable economic growth.
We can do better. And I will ask the Minnesota State Planning Agency to see that we do.
Fifth, our state is already a research and development center for electronics, computer technology and agriculture. Expanding our knowledge has meant expanded job opportunities. As one example, the University of Minnesota developed a way to use low-grade ore, revitalized the mining industry and created thousands of jobs.
The main emphasis of my message today is jobs. But we can also do better in health.
The state is blessed with many of the best health care resources in the nation.
We have excellent professional training. We work hard to improve the environment in which our people live. And we have superior health facilities.
But we are missing some great opportunities. Health care costs are too high. We don't put enough emphasis on illness prevention, on physical fitness or active recreation. We should do more in making progress against serious and crippling diseases.

We have made many important state commitments in the past six years. This year we need to dedicate a portion of our human and financial resources to finding some of the answers to better health care for more people.
Every dollar of our investment will bring five six or seven additional dollars of federal private and foundation funds. I believe we can keep such a commitment and I hope you will help me do it.
Minnesota's environmental quality and energy crisis also demands our serious attention.
The Dakota Indians named the state Minnesota -- "Minne" for water and "Sota" for white.
The Indians understood the environment, lived it and loved
it.
Perhaps the most tragic story of all in our decades of environmental exploitation is the story of how we destroyed the land the independence and the way of life of American Indians who preceded us by centuries on this land.

This administration will give special emphasis to improving state services for Indians. My recommendations will be included in the state budget.

Jobs are a major concern for all of us. And there is no need to abuse the environment to protect jobs. In fact, Minnesota history shows that the destruction of our natural resources means the destruction of industries that put people to work.
Our first major industry in what we now call Minnesota was furs. There were more than 150 fur outposts in Minnesota.
In that era, our leaders thought there was no end ever to the fur-bearing animals. They would continue to multiply no matter how many pelts were taken.
Wars were fought over the fur industry. This area, in fact, was colonized because of its fur-bearing animals.
There was no thought of tomorrow, and so those animals were destroyed and, in fact, they're just starting to come back.
Less than a century ago, miles and miles of white pine stretched all the way from southeastern Minnesota to the Canadian border. Thousands were employed as mill hands and lumberjacks in a great timber industry.
Our leaders in the 1880's were convinced there was no end to the white pine industry in Minnesota.
And most of those early lumberjacks were farmers. They harvested crops in the fall, trees in the winter.

Farmers planted crops, but nobody planted trees. Government could have required that one section be replanted as soon as cutting started on another. If that had been the law, we might still have a white pine industry in Minnesota, and majestic white pine trees today.
But no one made them do it. And 67 billion board feet of lumber left Minnesota. So did a major industry, and the jobs that went with it.
Commercial fishing is the same story. That industry in Minnesota, for all practical purposes, is gone--because nobody thought ahead.
When the fish are gone, the jobs are gone. When the trees are gone, the jobs are gone. And when the fur-bearing animals are gone, the jobs are gone.
Minnesota!s natural iron ore took 1.5 billion years to form. In one person's lifetime-~75 years--we mined all the natural ore in Minnesota. Nothing was done to preserve the environment in Northern Minnesota.
Minnesota's natural ore mines employed many more people than we have working now in the taconite industry. When the natural ore was gone, the jobs were gone.
If we had just had Legislative mine-land reclamation, there would be more jobs in Minnesota--jobs that restore and enhance our environment. Those jobs could be with us today.

Page 9
Only one state in the union has done less in mine-land reclamation than Minnesota. This administration intends to improve our standing dramatically.
Today we are witnessing the destruction of another magnificent resource--Lake Superior. For thousands of years the lake was pure. And in less than 20 years we befouled it. It will take 500 to 1,000 years before the asbestiform fibers settle out of the water.
It saddens me to think that 30 years ago we didn't heed the warning of one individual ~ now a Legislator, who spoke out in opposition
to granting a permit to Reserve Mining allowing them to dump taconite tailings into Lake Superior. At this time, 1 want to publicly recognize that individual, representative Willard Munger of Duluth.
And we still have not found a way to stop Reserve Mining from dumping into that lake and preserve the jobs of 3,000 Minnesota human, beings at the same time. We must do that and we will together during this Legislative session.
Lately we have started to do better. And we've been fortunate. We've had a second chance to turn environmental exploitation into environmental, social and economic efforts to develop these great resources. I'm proud of those efforts and I will continue to support them.
We are also facing the terrible effects of drought on our water resources. And they must be preserved and perpetuated.


The first step is to find out what we really have. We must finish the public water inventory of surface waters now underway. And we must start as soon as possible to make a comprehensive inventory of our underground water.
The record has improved in recent years. But most important our attitude is better. We are trying harder to keep what we have left.
We must also try much harder to preserve what we have left of our national energy resources. That means we must stop wasting energy.
Except for peat Minnesota has no natural energy resources at all.
Energy conservation must become a major state goa1 not because it is the proper thing to do, but because it's the only sane thing to duo Our quality of life depends on it.
We have some of the nation'ss pioneer energy conservation measures but they are not enough. This year I will ask the Legislature to approve the farthest-reaching and most comprehensive energy conservation program ever considered by any state.
It won't be an easy program to pass. It will affect a great many people. It will require some difficult changes for all of us. But there is no alternative--except disaster.
My proposals will include a state government energy conservation program to cut out energy use by 10 percent. It will require consideration of alternative energy in any new state buildings.


Conservation can do more than save energy. It can give us the time to develop alternative energy sources.
We must support plans to bring Alaska's oil and natural gas to Minnesota. We must also support the proposed coal use study of Minnesota's Environmental Quality Council.
And I pledge to you today that I will do everything I can to continue the Anderson Administration's effort to bring a new National Solar Energy Institute to Minnesota.
We have an opportunity to become a mode) state in energy conservation and research. I can't imagine a more important goal.
But whatever we do to conserve energy! we are still going to need more of the electrical power it provides.
Because of your good work, we now have state laws that regulate the siting of power plants or power lines in the state. But some of our citizens thing they are unfair.
You already have Governor Anderson's recommendation before you.
And I want to announce today that Speaker Martin Sabo and Majority Leader Nicholas Coleman, Senator Gerald Willet and Representative Willard Munger have agreed to hold joint hearings on power line sitings within the next two weeks. They will be held in the area affected by the UPA-CPA line. Lieutenant Governor Alec Olson will represent me at those meetings and will give the power line conflict priority attention.


We will need more electrical power in Minnesota. We must be sure that we get it the right way.
Our energy and environmental needs require a new commitment of government, industry and the people of Minnesota to form a partnership for the future.
In the long run, our high quality of life depends on our ability to keep a healthy environment, healthy people and a healthy economy.
To do that, we must also have a healthy relationship with the federal government in Washington.
That's why I have assigned Lieutenant Governor Alec Olson to improve state-federal cooperation and coordination.
Vice President Mondale comes from this state. We have two strong senators and real Minnesota leadership in the United States House of Representatives.
They can help us and I know they will, not only to bring more federal dollars to Minnesota, but also to help cities and counties and school districts keep doing a good job for our people.
We can speak for all Minnesota government, state and local, and that is what I'm asking Lieutenant Governor Alec Olson to do.
The state of Minnesota does a good job for its people. We have-identified and assisted those with special needs. We have developed many programs and improved many others. We have invested heavily in opportunity for our people.


We have tried to make state and local government work well and give our people more equal services through fair taxes and fair funding. We have also improved our management of state funds and state budgets. We have been able to. do our work and serve our people without increasing any major state taxes during the past two Legislative sessions.
I hope we will not increase taxes in this session either. We will have enough revenue to keep our state budget balanced for the next two years and that makes us more fortunate than many other states. But there will be no extra money.
The resources provided by our taxpayers are precious. They come from people who work hard for a living. We already ask more from. them than most states do.
It is time for us to enter a new era in Minnesota state government. The time is coming when Governors and Legislators will no longer be judged on the number of their new proposals or their success in passing them. Instead, the test will be our wisdom and skill in making present laws work well for our people.
There will continue to be a need for some new laws and for refinement of the laws we have.
But our highest priorities should be management, responsiveness, cooperation instead of competition--the best possible service at the lowest possible cost.
We must pay as much attention to the quality of our stewardship as we do to the nobility of our purpose. That is what our people want and that is what they deserve from us.


For my part, I do not intend to make promises that we cannot fulfill.
We already have excellent state government leadership, thanks to Governor Anderson, the LEAP Program and this Legislature.
Our financial stability has earned this state government a triple A credit rating, the highest there is.
Because of administrative and organizational reforms, we have better tools than ever before. Now, together, is the time to use those tools.
We do not need more state employees. We do need to get full value for every dollar we spend.
And all of us meet today to celebrate the Minnesota spirit-that people are the strength and purpose of government.
As I see it, I have three tasks before me: 1. To run the Executive Branch honestly, efficiently, openly and compassionately. 2. To cooperate with you, the Legislature, in making sound policy and carrying it out well. 3. Above all, to listen to and talk with, the people.
As I try to do that, my goal will be a government that works hard for people and not for self-preservation. My goal will be a government that responds more imaginatively to the needs and the rights of the people of Minnesota.


The number of women and minority citizens in positions of responsibility is insignificant compared with their contributions to society. I pledge to bring more minorities and women into major policy positions in state government.
I will also work for more participation and involvement of the people who give us their resources and our strengths. Many people have volunteered to help and I know that they can help. They have much to show us and we have much to show the nation by making good use of them. I am determined to do that.
I'm also determined to give individual Minnesota citizens the information and help they need from our state agencies.
This state has pioneered open meetings, but real openness means being willing and prepared to answer the questions of citizens with great respect and greater speed. It also means listening to complaints and suggestions and taking recommendations seriously.
The openness of government to the public is the key to responsive, compassionate and truly effective government.
I approach my new tasks with great enthusiasm for what has been accomplished, and great excitement for what still remains to be done.
I promise today to work untiringly with you to fulfill our Minnesota spirit. lIve worked in this building for a long time and know most of you well. My office and my staff will help you in any way we can.


But I also need your help. I ask for it and I welcome it. And we can all succeed if we work together and live by the words described in a plaque that was presented to me by a center for handicapped people. The plaque reads: None of us is as smart as all of us. 1I
We have been blessed by the land of this state. Our resources have given us productive farms and forests, mines,and other industries.
But our state has not been made great just because of those resources. It is our people who have made those resources productive farmers and forest managers, miners and factory workers, good business people, good legislators and good public officials.
The real resource of this successful society is our people and the Minnesota spirit they have produced.
Have a good session.
Thank you very much.

Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices, Members of the 7lst Minnesota State Legislature, Fellow Constitutional Officers, Governors, distinguished guests and good friends.
As I have thought about your return to the Capitol and the beginning of this second session of the 7lst Minnesota Legislature, I have tried to sort out the significance of the work we begin.
When we have Russia perched on the border of Iran --
When we have worldwide apprehensions about a shaky economic future --
When night after night for 81 consecutive nights, we have heard the television report that begins "America held hostage."



In a world seemingly caught up in fear and hate and greed, what is the meaning of our actions over the next few months? Do they even matter? Do they have any lasting significance? Do they make any difference at all?

I would guess there are some lonely moments when each of you have asked yourself the same haunting questions and maybe there are times when the answers do not come clearly or don't come at all.

But upon some genuine soul searching, I have come to see that what we do in the days ahead is the very heart of all the international issues. In a very real sense, this is the battleground No, I am not talking about our partisan disputes-- the skirmishes between the House and Senate, Republican and Democrat, the legislative and executive -- these squabbles pale in the light of the larger concern. No, this is the battleground where we test, where we prove that a self-governing society is worth the sacrifice. Here is where we demonstrate that a free people have the discipline, the drive, the sense of purpose



to solve their problems. As I think about the importance of our work over the next few months, John Gardner's words keep coming back to me: "This free society begins with us. It must not end with us."

It will not, if we act responsibly, if we take control of our lives, if each of us realizes that we have tasks to perform, whether we be in government, business, education, civic organizations or within our families. The problems that confront this nation and this state do not fall exclusively on government or solely to the private sector. The issues on our agenda call on every person, every institution -- without exception.

Nowhere is that more apparent than in the energy issue. Just look at what Minnesotans are doing.

The Twin City Carpenters District Council, with the support of the Minnesota AFL-CIO, has volunteered to amend its rules on the apprentice-journeyman relationship so they can help the state's effort in weatherizing homes. with labor's help and CETA's workers, we can vastly increase the rate at which we weatherize our homes.



The Minnesota Business Partnership, an organization of the 50 largest companies in the state, representing over 10%. of our employees, is promoting ridesharing, vanpooling and other transit options as a means of getting employees to and from work conveniently at less cost to the worker and greater savings for all.

According to a sample of its members, the Minnesota Association of Commerce and Industry reports that nearly one~half of the firms have made extensive conservation efforts.

Public affairs organizations, such as the Citizens League, the Upper Midwest Council and the Urban Coalition all are contributing to the development of new ideas.

Local governments in Minnesota have taken some dramatic initiatives. That is clearly evident here in St. Paul. Moorhead has developed a comprehensive energy policy for municipal government operations.. New Ulm is planning a campaign to distribute conservation literature to every household in the city. Nine Iron Range communities and



the Arrowhead Economic Opportunity Agency are cooperating on a waste-elmwood program to debark elmwood and to distribute it for home heating fuel.

Hosts of individuals have silently done their part to conserve, as well.

This is the kind of spirit that lives in a free, creative, dynamic self-governing society. This is the kind of resilience Americans have. While there may be those on foreign shores who predict that the energy crisis will be our downfall, I predict it will be the issue that demonstrates to all the world the deep strength and true endurance of the American people.

We in state government also have a part to play. As I see it, the state has seven responsibilities in dealing with the energy issue.

First, it has to set an example. We cannot squander if we expect others to save.



Last spring, I asked state agencies to reduce over the next year the business miles driven by state employees by 10%. And we will meet that goal -- a reduction of four million miles. By buying smaller cars we improve our mileage anywhere from 11% to 28%.

You set aside $4 million for retrofitting state buildings. This session, I am asking for another $2.7 million. This $6.7 million investment will more than pay for itself in five years.

Second, the state should influence federal priorities. If the federal government attempts to heat southern swimming pools rather than northern homes, we must protest. If the federal government uses a system of energy aid which dispenses checks automatically, regardless of need for fuel assistance, we must protest. If these checks provide fuel assistance to those in prison, in nursing homes and on tropical islands, we must protest. If we have learned anything from the federal government's recent fiasco, it is that this state government



cannot afford either in terms of dollars or public confidence -- to enter into a statewide system of energy support which automatically dispenses money, regardless of energy needs and without an individualized and personalized review.

While Minnesota received approximately $79 million this year from the federal government, we may receive well over $100 million next year.

Consequently, my energy proposals are designed to take care of the unique needs of Minnesotans and at the same time capitalize on the infusion of expected federal dollars which should make a permanent state program unnecessary or at least greatly reduce it in scope.

In the upcoming months, as ~hese federal programs start to take shape, we will develop a state plan for the expenditure of those dollars, a plan which will be due in October or November 1980. This session we should realize that developing a coordinated energy program with federal and local government will be an evolving process.

Third, the state in cooperation with the federal government must help our needy citizens meet their energy costs.

Federal programs this winter will assist those with incomes up to 125% of poverty. Minnesota can and should do more. We should assist those with incomes between 125 and 150% of poverty -- and do so on a sliding scale.

I know some legislators believe we should extend the state's help to those with higher incomes. No matter where we draw the line, it will no doubt seem unfair to those just beyond it. We must be wise enough to strike the delicate balance between providing assistance to those who need it and recognizing the circumstances of those who not only have to pay their own costs but have to be taxed to assist others.

I propose that we continue the state crisis fuel program operating since October. This program gives the opportunity to obtain fuel to anyone who needs it but has no liquid assets to purchase fuel.



To meet the rising costs of fuel faced by-school districts, I am recommending an additional $12.4 million for transportation aid in 1980 and 1981. This item will be financed by the projected cancellations under the foundation- aid formula.

Fourth, the state must encourage everyone to undertake conservation efforts. One of the first places to start is in the home.

We've all heard the figure that approximately 30% of the heat in a home can be lost through the roof because of inadequate insulation. A 1979 survey indicated that 12% of Minnesota homes did not have any insulation at all and another 55% had less than 6 inches, or half the recommended level. Weatherizing these homes would result in significant energy savings.

I am proposing $11 million for additional weatherization grants. This proposal is in addition to the $45 million in loans for home improvements which will be available from February 1 to December 31. This program administered by the Housing Finance Agency is, I understand, the largest loan program in any state.

Besides our homes, another place we can encourage conservation is in our neighborhoods. Some of this is already beginning. In St. Paul, I know, there are neighborhoods where people are cooperating as a neighborhood organization to arrange for plowing of alleys, collecting of refuse.and repairing or insulating of homes. I believe that inventive people could also find new ways in neighborhoods to arrange for the delivery of other services that relate to energy conservation.

Certainly if there were a major crisis in oil supply, we would depend heavily on people to work out cooperative ways where they live to get each other to work, to the store and to church.

I hope that city councils and mayors will cooperate with these neighborhood efforts and encourage them.

The state itself can cooperate with cities in other ways.

I am requesting that the state participate with St. Paul and Northern States Power Company in a proposed district heating program. This could well serve as a model for other Minnesota communities. I have requested that you appropriate $2.7 million for our share of the initial' capital costs.

Furthermore, I believe that local government should be authorized to levy one-mill over levy limits specifically for energy conservation.

One of the most promising energy conservation measures the state can promote is ridesharing and vanpooling. We must encourage a more limited reliance on the single occupant car, especially for trips to and from work. For example, in the metropolitan area the MTC does a good job in feeding the central cities, but more than half of the jobs in the metro area are located in places that are not and could not realistically be provided for by bus system.



Because of the great potential for substantial energy savings in ridesharing and vanpooling, I am recommending $1.5 million which will provide us with a 15% tax credit for employer-sponsored vanpools, an expansion of the state fleet, an expansion of ridesharing and an increased enforcement of the 55 mi1e-per-hour speed limit. These actions could save Minnesota an estimated 52 million gallons of gas every year.

Fifth, the state government must seek to assure an uninterrupted supply of fuel. This is particularly critical for us because 60% of the crude oil used by the state's four refineries comes from Canada which is planning to phase out its crude oil exports to the United States. New crude pipelines are needed quickly -- one from the west and one from the south, and we will continue to push for them.

The sixth responsibility the state has is to encourage alternative energy sources. Minnesota has many possibilities to increase our use of renewable resources. I have asked for $1.3 million for this purpose next year.



This proposal provides for a gasohol demonstration program for farm-scale production operated by the University of Minnesota Department of Agricultural Engineering, a fuelwood management program, and a state alternative energy contingency account to provide state participation in wind resources, biomass-wetlands agriculture, and agricultural residue projects when non-state funds are committed for the demonstration projects.

The final obligation of the state is to inform the public about our choices. Government obviously cannot. do this alone and I want to note in particular the excellent work the media in Minnesota has done in helping the people understand the energy problem. A good job. The state must expand its efforts in public information, energy education and encouraging community support. I am requesting $1.3 million to be invested in this effort.

The energy program I have outlined includes assistance to our people, our schools and our cities. In addition, the state itself will require $9 million to cover its increased fuel costs. Together, these recommendations total $56.6 million.



During the past several months, I have traveled extensively and listened carefully to our people. I have attempted to prepare an energy package which has their support. As our energy ideas are discussed in these halls, I would anticipate much agreement. There may be different views as to how the state should integrate its efforts with the federal government, but we should not let our differences overshadow our common goals.

On the wall of the Senate Majority Leader's office hangs a sign with a Will Rogers' quote: "If we need wood, we chop down a tree. If we need oil, we dig a hole. If we want steam, we dig for coal. When we run out of these, we'll find out how good we are."

I think we are good to adapt and -- yes job done.

good enough to conserve, to innovate, good-enough to cooperate to get the

It is paradoxical that at the same time we ask people to reduce their travel and use less gas, the state is hurt by such action through its loss of revenue from the gas tax.



The costs of maintaining and constructing our roads have increased dramatically. The receipts to fund these programs have gone down. As a result, 61 highway projects totaling $122 million have already been deferred. If nothing is done this session, another $150 million in deferrals is possible. It is further projected that we will have a shortfall in revenues amounting to $300 million in 1982-83 and $450 million for 1984-85.

The choice is simple.

We can either invest now and protect the $16 billion we have put into our road system, or we can allow the deterioration of that network which will ultimately impair the economic future of Minnesota.

Over the past months, I have explored many options to fund our transportation network. I have sought to develop a balanced proposal to raise the necessary revenues. The highway funding package that I submit to you has four basic elements.

First, I propose a 4% sales tax on gasoline, the same percentage as our general sales tax. The tax would be on the pump price of gas less existing state and federal taxes.

The second part of my proposal is to cut the existing 9 cents per gallon state tax on gasoline to 7 cents. The combination of these two actions will make the overall tax more inflation sensitive.

Let me stop here a moment to try to clear up some confusion which has surrounded this proposal. Some have asked how is this recommendation consistent with my long standing commitment to indexing. I am extremely proud of the indexing we accomplished last session.



But indexing does not prevent the income tax you pay from rising with inflation, it simply prevents your tax payments from rising faster than inflation. Likewise, the revenues from Minnesota's 4% sales tax rise with inflation.

The third element of my proposal would authorize $150 million in general obligation bonds to be used over the next five years for the state's share of interstate highway funding. Interstate construction is funded 90% by the federal government. Minnesota's failure to raise the remaining 10% would result in our forfeiting the federal share.

The last element of my proposal is to shift the 4% excise tax on motor vehicle sales from the general fund to the highway fund. This transfer would begin on July 1 of 1981 and would begin with 25% of the excise tax being allocated to highways. In each of the succeeding three years an additional 25% would be transferred from the general fund, reaching 100% in 1984.



If we are to keep jobs in Minnesota, we must keep up our roads.

Environment We've talked about conserving energy in Minnesota, conserving and maintaining our roads -- but equally as important is conserving our natural resources.

Stewardship of our natural environment is a God-given responsibility. Again the responsibility falls on each one of us as you will see in the following initiatives:

I will call a State Environmental Conference this year to allow maximum public participation in a comprehensive review that I want undertaken. This review will focus on the state's role in environmental matters which is spread over some 85 programs.

-- I have prepared five bills for your consideration which will help focus the work of the Environmental Quality Board on the more significant issues and streamline the process of environmental reviews. There are too many delays and burdensome paperwork requirements now involved in the process.



I will support legislation to continue the work begun by the Water Planning Board when its legislative authority again terminates at the end of this fiscal year by incorporating those responsibilities under the Environmental Quality Board.

-- I have asked our state agencies to pursue with mining interests and the citizens most affected, how best to manage the development of our huge potential in copper and nickel and to address uranium exploration -- doing all of that while staying within sound environmental guidelines.

-- I have determined that an independent assessment of the safety of Minnesota's nuclear power plants should be undertaken. Thus, I have appointed a Nuclear Safety Committee. They have begun a comprehensive review of the safety of nuclear power plants and will, by April 1980, report to me their recommendations.



-- I will work in harmony with the Joint Legislative Committee on Solid and Hazardous Waste to discover answers to the safe disposal of an estimated 128,000 tons of hazardous waste per year. My preference is that those companies producing the waste should assume the primary responsibility for disposing it. If government action is necessary, the counties involved should next get into the act. Then, only if required, the State should enter the disposal siting picture and look first at the suitability of land already owned by the State. Throughout this process of locating and using disposal sites, regardless of sponsorship, the State will monitor the environmental impacts.

-- In the area of solid waste, I will support legislation that places the responsibility of planning and siting waste disposal areas at the county level. Equally important, the legislation must be tied closely to resource recovery programs.

Three weeks ago, I transmitted to the Legislature a Report on Environmental Quality. This report will allow everyone to see the wide range, complexity and urgency of dozens of environmental challenges facing Minnesota.



I will continue to work with you on the many environmental issues which we now know will be a constant public concern for as long as we inhabit this earth.

As I look at the priorities before us -- energy, transportation, environment -- I am optimistic that this can be a productive legislative session -- and hopefully a short one.

To that end, I have purposely limited my address today to major issues.

My concerns go beyond these limited number of issues. My legislative proposals, covering numerous topics from aid to the hearing impaired to agricultural promotion, are drafted in bill form, being readied for introduction.
You will also be receiving a statement on community development on February 7.



Today, you will receive the detailed description of my energy proposals for the 1980 session.

Budget You will also receive later today my supplemental budget recommendations. Let me simply summarize the budget highlights

The Department of Finance has projected a general fund balance of $84.7 million. $6.9 million will be used for salary increases due to the automatic cost of living increases. $4 million is dedicated to the capital budget. Proposed legislation accounts for $2.8 million and budget supplements amount to $10.1 million. My energy proposals will use $44.2 million from the projected balance plus $12.4 million of projected cancellations which I mentioned earlier for a total of $56. million for energy related assistance.

This will leave us $21 million as a protection against our income projections not being realized. For a $7.4 billion dollar biennial budget, that measure of protection represents only 3/10ths of 1%. It is prudent to maintain such a reserve for there are no attractive alternatives for cutting state spending in the final months of a fiscal year.
I believe the state can make substantial progress on these key issues within those budget constraints. Such progress would be a good record for any legislative session but this time, in this session, the people expect more from us. They care about this system of government and they want to see it work -- and if it can, they want to see it work better.

There are improvements needed in state government. Improvements that have the overwhelming support of the people of this state. And because of that, they cannot be ignored.
Therefore, I am proposing that the Legislature approve four constitutional amendments.



Since I have spoken out on these proposals extensively in the last month, I will not elaborate on them now'. I am conscious of the fact that one should not begin what is hoped to be a very short session with a very long speech.

First, I am proposing an amendment for initiative and referendum. Because I believe so strongly that citizens ought to be enabled to participate directly in the passage and repeal of laws, I made initiative and referendum the subject of my first campaign position paper in March of 1978. The proposal has been drafted in a manner which ensures that any petition would first have to have substantial support of citizens in all counties before it would come before the voters.

Second, I propose an amendment to require a 60% vote of
both houses of the Legislature to increase taxes. In the
past, taxes have been increased without adequate attention
having been given to their effects. An increase in taxation
should require a stronger consensus of the Legislature than
is now necessary as is the case with bonding decisions.



Third, I propose an amendment to limit increases in state spending. By limiting increases in state spending to the rate of growth in non-farm personal income, we can impose a discipline on state spending, and protect the people from the threat of government taking an ever larger share of their earnings. Over the past 10 years, state spending has increased 200% while non-farm personal income increased 106%. This amendment includes a provision that allows a two-thirds vote of both houses to override the spending limit in times of emergency.

There is a provision in this amendment which also requires that the state pay for programs it mandates for local government.

Fourth, I propose an amendment to create a bipartisan reapportionment committee. It is time that we remove reapportionment from the political arena. The people of Minnesota deserve a system which is free from partisanship. Our legislative and congressional district boundaries should be drawn to satisfy the best interests of the people, not for the advantage



of anyone political party. And I want to commend this Legislature for having passed this bill for a bipartisan commission in both houses in the last session.

In conclusion, we live in a world filled with strife and controversy. We have quite enough tension. Yet, there seems to be great expectation by some that the next few months of this legislative session may well add to what presently exists.

It need not be so. That which binds us is vastly more enduring than that which divides us.

Let us approach the issues before us with the sense of commitment that serious issues demand if they are to be resolved.



-- With the understanding that the public good must prevail over individual advantage  . .

-- With the courage to lead at a time when leadership may be painful   .

with the strength to persevere even when success may be uncertain . . .

with this kind of spirit we can do what must be done. And having done it, should that question come back before us, "Did our contributions have any lasting significance, any enduring value?" We will be able to say "Yes, yes we have made a difference."

Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices, Members of the 72nd State Legislature, Fellow Constitutional Officers, Governors, distinguished guests, friends and fellow Minnesotans,
Welcome back. I am looking forward to this legislative session-as I'm sure you are. We have many decisions to make. They will not be easy-they never are. But they will have a lasting impact on the future of this state.
This year the State of the State message cannot be given without looking at the state of the nation. We are gathering at a time of great uncertainty and unrest. Daily we watch the indicators . . . how deep is the recession? when will we start coming out of it? . . . how fast? We try to read the signs. We remain fundamentally hopeful--but realistically cautious, for we are still feeling the pain of a great economy struggling for new life.
We've seen prime interest rates soar to more than 20 percent, a major auto manufacturer 'facing bankruptcy, a sharp rise in unemployment, decline in average weekly earnings, a continued rise in the Consumer Price Index, and drastic declines in new housing.

The Middle East crisis again threatens our oil supplies.

Petroleum prices are increasing.

Energy rich states beckon industries from the energy poor states.

The recession has also hurt state and local governments.

Two years ago, state and local governments across the nation had an annual surplus of $4.2 billion. Now, just two years later, it is predicted their combined deficits will exceed $15 billion.

Minnesota has not been spared the effects of this recession.

Since we met, just nine months ago, many of our people have .been through difficult times--and it's not over yet.

I found it necessary, because of falling revenue receipts, to cut back state spending by $195 million for this fiscal year. If a majority of you in the Legislature can come up with a different way to handle the shortfall, I will be glad to work with you to find an amicable solution for the good of the people, since we still have six months until the end of the biennium.

This recession has meant our citizens have had to tighten their belts and live within their means. Is it any wonder that they expect the federal government, the state government and local government to do the same?
That is why the most important message that can come in this State of the State and the most important accomplishment of this legislative session would be this guarantee:
--No action by this Legislature which will increase the income or sales tax rates.
--No action which will cause property taxes to rise faster than the rate of inflation over the biennium.
Let me tell you why I so firmly believe that we must make this commitment to our people.
First, this recession has hurt. When people are working hard just to meet the house payments and pay the grocery bills, it is not the time to increase their taxes.
Keep in mind that if we compare the fall of 1979 with the fall of 1980, the actual number of jobs available was down 1.3 percent. Keep in mind that Minnesota is 19th among states in per capita income but eighth in the nation for its total tax burden, and 45th when comparing personal income remaining

after state and local taxes. We have the third highest personal income tax
(before indexing), and fourth highest corporate income tax.
Before 1979, before we indexed our state income tax, Minnesotans' income taxes went up more than a third faster than their income. Money came into the state coffers so fast that in the 1978-79 biennium Minnesota's state government spending grew by twice the rate of inflation. Such a practice had to stop or Minnesota state government spending would continue growing at an astronomical rate--we should bear in mind that in the last 14 years, state spending has doubled three times.
That is Why I made indexing the income tax one of the priorities of my campaign. That is why I continue to believe that adoption of indexing was one of the most important tax reforms in Minnesota's history. That is why I will resist any efforts to abandon indexing. This mechanism spreads the income tax brackets so that people whose incomes go up at the rate of inflation stay within the same brackets.
Now, when confronted with requests for new programs, we have to make the choice openly, Do we want to raise taxes and expand services? Or do we not raise taxes and basically let government spending grow at the rate of inflation?
We face that decision this session. It will not be an easy one.

There are still decisions to be made on the budget. I will announce
those in my budget message in three weeks.
In the meantime there are many optimistic signs for Minnesota's
future that should encourage us, We need a larger view of our state's
future than one which looks only at the next budget period.
Consider agriculture which accounts for about 45 percent of
Minnesota's gross state production. We have a tremendous future
demand throughout the world increases for food & fiber.
One of the areas of concern for agriculture is transportation.
If we produce food, and the world needs it, no ore will benefit if we
can't transport goods over highways, rail and water.
I have appointed a Task Force on Highways for Economic Vitality
to review transportation needs and funding. It has finished its work and
will soon send its report to me. Pm also waiting for a report from your Legislative Select Committee on Transportation, as soon as your task force has reported, I will call the two groups together to resolve any differences
and then make my recommendation to you.
Minnesota's future also holds bright prospects for dramatic growth
of our high technology industries.

Futurists predict that we are moving to an "information" society based on very sophisticated or "high" technology. As one informed observer recently said: The United States is rapidly shifting from a mass industrial society to an information society, and the final impact will be more profound than the 19th Century shift from an agricultural to an industrial society.
Minnesota1s computer industry will have a key role in the development of the information society. In several technologies--not just computers- Minnesota may also grow as a national and international leader.
Technology intensive industries provide the state with a broad and resilient economic base of high quality jobs for its citizens. Minnesota is generating small technology industries a rate two to three times the national average. These not only produce exciting jobs for Minnesotans but will assure America its position as the leader in technology production.
Throughout the United States we see five technological centers--Boston, the Washington-Baltimore corridor, the triangle area in North Carolina, Dallas and Houston, San Francisco. In the Midwest, there is no such center. With our industries, with the great research and teaching resources of the University of Minnesota Institute of Technology, we can become that center in the Midwest.
We have a tremendous opportunity for new jobs in high technology industries. And significantly, as we seek to meet our social responsibilities, we should remember that these companies have shown they can serve the central cities and reach minorities and the disadvantaged.

Minnesota's timber resources also give us great cause for optimism for the future.
More than 17 million acres in our state are wooded. That's fully a third of all the land in Minnesota. Almost 14 million acres are commercial forests, administered privately and by the state, federal or county governments.
Timber production and subsequent harvests can be substantially increased with improved timber management. According to the University of Minnesota School of Forestry, Minnesota forest production can be increased 25 to 40 percent.
I will be recommending significant steps to improve forest management. I want to commend the Legislature for the important steps taken by your Legislative Commission on Minnesota Resources. Because of your efforts we are ready for the next step in expanding the production, the harvest, the use, the jobs that will come with development of our timber resources.
As we take a broader look at Minnesota's future let us also remember that we are one of the most minerally rich states in the Union.
Minnesota has 25 percent of the nation's known copper resources and 12 percent of the world's known nickel reserves. Our mines produce 70 percent of the United States' taconite and iron ore. Minnesota has the only known cobalt deposit in the nation.

Even though Northeastern Minnesota has recently had economic difficulties because of a slowing in demand for steel, think what the problems would be without the research of Dr. E. W. Davis of the Mineral Resources Research Center,who developed the process for utilizing taconite. For a decade we have neglected mineral research; we must reverse that neglect and again support adequate minerals research.
Just as the creation of a taconite tax policy helped create that major Minnesota industry, we need tax policies for other minerals, particularly for mining of copper and nickel.
The development of our mineral resources can be of dramatic benefit to the people of our state, but we must extract and process those minerals in a manner which protects the high quality of our environment.
Maintaining the quality of life will also help to keep strong another key industry--tourism--which depends on the great natural beauty of our state.
In 1980, tourism contributed $2 billion to our economy, employed 120,000 Minnesotans and gave us $130 million in tax revenues. We should not forget the contributions of this industry. Our Department of Economic Development will maintain strong support for tourism.

I mentioned petroleum prices and supplies earlier, but there are some points of optimism about energy.
A crude oil pipeline from the south, adequate for our needs, is being constructed now and will be completed by this fall. If Canadian oil is cut off in the future we will have a means of bringing crude oil into Minnesota.
We have been successful in maintaining first priority for Canadian oil.
Money is coming in for development of alternative fuel.
We will be making headway in district heating.
Conservation efforts are paying off both in heating and in transportation: demand for gasoline is down? percent and demand for fuel oil has been reduced 12 percent.
Let me also note that as we continue to be concerned about the potential problem of industry leaving Minnesota for the energy rich Western states, we should not forget that the Western states are short of water. Minnesota is blessed with an abundant supply of good water. That should give us special incentive to make certain our water is conserved and kept clean.
Finally, we must never neglect our most valuable resources--our children-or forget the state's responsibility for their education.

As I have said before, one of the most difficult decisions I have had to make during my administration was to cut state aid to elementary and secondary schools when our revenues fell last summer.
The impact of that cutback was, however, cushioned substantially by the fact that most schools could draw on reserves that they had accumulated. When the $89 million cutback was announced, it was estimated that school districts had $285 million in reserves. These were, of course, accumulated in varying amounts by district. It should be kept in mind that the average amount of the recision equaled $97 per pupil unit. However, 83 percent of the school districts, with over 91 percent of the student&, had reserves in excess of $100 per pupil unit.
Frankly, the main concern I heard when I announced the cutback was not just the impact of the cut this year, but its potential impact in future years. Let me repeat my pledge: I will recommend that we restore the base to the level before the cutback in each year of the next biennium.
I will recommend that we increase the state's share of aid to education by the rate of inflation.
These recommendations will give education the largest dollar increase in the history of the state.
Furthermore, the actions of the last legislative session reduced the local effort in Fiscal Year 1982 from 26 percent of the cost of education to 19.3 percent. In other words, the local property taxes for operating schools raised $412 million in Fiscal Year 1981 and will be reduced to $331 million in Fiscal Year 1982. This means the state will pay 80 percent of the cost of education and local property taxes will fund 20 percent. This funding relationship goes well beyond the intent of the Minnesota Miracle to have the state share 70 percent of education costs. We must rev~ew this funding relationship in the context of a commitment not to increase the income or sales tax rates and not to have property taxes rise faster than the rate of inflation.
With this obligation there is not room to fund my proposal to improve education in the kindergarten through third grade. Explicit state funding for that concept will have to wait, but I will continue to urge:
--That parents and teachers become stronger partners in the child's learning process.
--That schools hold class size down in the early years to provide for more individual instruction.
--That we continue to seek environments free from disruptions which impair students' learning.

As we now begin this 72nd session of the Minnesota Legislature, we take up the task of shaping the future of our great state. Let us be mindful of our past. Let us remember our forefathers who worked to build this great state. They farmed the land, laid out the roads, built the ports, mined the ores, developed the technology. They have given us a great state, strong, diverse, able to provide good jobs for our people.
True, we are in troubled times but we know our parents and grandparents suffered hardships far greater than we have now. Their material goods were less; for most, the physical work was harder, their lives shortened by disease.
We must also remember that during those same years, men and women have come to these halls, setting aside personal gain to seek the public interest. They have given us an outstanding school system, an extensive park system, a broad transportation system, compassionate social services and a national reputation for good government.
The challenge before this legislative session is to respect the contributions over the past century made by millions of private citizens and thousands of public servants and to build on their heritage.
That is an awesome, never-ending task. One that calls forth the best in all of us. Do we have what it takes? Are we equal to it?

Can there be any other answer worthy of us but yes?
Yes, we can do it--
If we have faith in ourselves, faith in our fellow man, faith in our God.
Yes, we can do it if we aspire to work at it, aspire to fulfill our responsibility, aspire to achieve our ideals.
Yes, we can do it if we care--care for those who are different, those less fortunate; care for the impact our actions have on our own families and our children1s children.
Yes, we have what it takes if we ,care enough to work together to get it done.

Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices, Members of the 72nd State Legislature, Fellow Constitutional Officers, Governors, distinguished guests, friends and fellow Minnesotans:
We know that the national economy is struggling. And because of this, we know that Minnesota's economy is struggling.
But we also know that we will rebound from these difficulties and that we will be stronger for them. This is as certain as our people's strength and our land's abundance.
Just as certain is the fact that government will not be the same in the future as it's been in the past.
In part because of current economic problems; in part because of economic problems that may persist; but in largest part because of winds that awaken the nation, the role state government plays will be different.
It will be more trusting.
The roles local government, families, individuals and the private sector will play will be different too.

They will be larger.
These changes will be good for Minnesota and for our nation.
I want to talk this afternoon about these changing roles and my proposals and ideas for enhancing them in the next year, the next five years and the years beyond. These changes have been spurred, nationally and at home, by millions of votes and millions of voices.
Why do we face our current economic problems? Members of both parties don't agree on every point, but there is uniform agreement on the major cause: a national recession that is hurting 33 states in the same way it's hurting Minnesota.
But there are additional factors causing our projected budget shortfall.
Farm income is down significantly, reducing tax revenues, depressing farm communities and hurting farm families.
And state government has assumed too many obligations.
We must change the current arrangement so that local communities have a greater chance to run their own affairs, free of state intrusion.
We must look to the future realistically and responsibly.

We must change our policies so that we avoid, as much as possible, again having to make the terribly painful and disruptive choices that we must make now.
But more than a change in policy, we need a change in attitude.
Americans have come to realize, in a relatively short period, the real limits on our energy resources and the need to conserve them. In the same way that wasting energy was second nature to many of us a few years ago, saving energy is now instinctive.
We must develop the same responsible attitude toward government and its capacity. Only in this way can we plan wisely,
The times demand that we do better in providing public services. The men and women who carry out these services do a commendable, often excellent job, And our public institutions are not without cause for praise. We must not fall into the trap of criticizing, never nurturing them,
But the fact remains that government has grown too big and too expensive and we must look for new ways of serving the public; new ways that meet our responsibilities as a caring people; but ways that halt the prohibitive rise in the cost of government.
We can find new ways.

The proposals I will make to the 1982 Legislature are in six major areas:
(1) Because jobs mean individual dignity and economic health, I will propose steps to improve the capacity of Minnesota's private sector to create good jobs;
(2) because we must increase equity and local responsibility in education, I will propose improvements in the way in which we fund our schools;
(3) because we must strengthen the relationship people have with local. government, I will propose reforms in the financial relationship between the state and local units of government;
(4) because we must show greater trust in the wisdom and compassion of local officials, I will propose elimination of stifling state mandates and regulations;
(5) because we must find less disruptive ways of settling our public labor-management disputes, I will propose changes in the Public Employees Labor Relations Act (PELRA) so that the public is better protected; and
(6) because drinking drivers are killing innocent people, as well as themselves, I will propose a stronger program to end this utterly senseless carnage by getting them off the road.


Let me describe these initiatives in greater detail.

First, I will propose legislation that will mean more jobs for Minnesotans.

Jobs, jobs, jobs. They are what we must have or else everything falls apart: Individual lives are pained, families break apart and the economy collapses. I'm determined that we do all we can to assure a good future for Minnesota's working men and women.

I propose that we lift the burden that we have heaped on the private sector so that we free the creativity and industry of our people. My program for improving our job climate includes the following points:

--We must bring our workers' compensation system into competitive posture

with those of our neighboring states. This can only be done through substantial

change in the benefit provisions of Minnesota's workers' compensation law. The

report, presented to the Legislature yesterday by Insurance Commissioner

Michael Markman recommends this change as the only way to bring our system into

line with those of neighboring states. We must control costs for employers while

fully maintaining a workers' compensation system that provides adequate benefits

paid promptly and equitably to men and women injured on the job.

--We must improve our unemployment compensation system so that it doesn't run a deficit--as it now does and so that it doesn't have to borrow from the federal government--as it has done for years. Our current system is forced to do this despite the fact that our unemployment rate is significantly lower than the national average. My proposal will lead to a solvent trust fund a more equitable distribution of costs based on the direct experience of employers and assurance that workers who lose their jobs are treated fairly. The proposal will also encourage unemployed workers to obtain suitable employment as soon as possible.
Several points in my job climate proposal call for eliminating obstacles to job growth found in Minnesota's tax system. Changes would take effect in the next biennium.
--We must recognize the importance of small business in the creation of new jobs. Toward this end I recommend that we reduce the corporate tax rate to 6 percent on the first $100,000 of income,
--We must reduce commercial-industrial property taxes. I will recommend that the first $50,000 of commercial-industrial market value be assessed at a reduced rate of 30 percent. Twenty-five percent of commercial-industrial property in the metropolitan area and about 40 percent of such property in nonmetropolitan areas of Minnesota have market values below $50,000.

--And we must bring three additional taxes into conformity with federal schedules: Capital gains taxes, estate taxes, and depreciation rates.
I will also recommend two initiatives that recognize the important role played by high technology in Minnesota's future, and the increasingly important role that must be played by the private sector in helping meet community and' human needs.
--I will propose a challenge grant program that will meet, dollar for dollar, private contributions to three research centers at the University of Minnesota's Institute of Technology. These are the Microelectronics Center, the Productivity Center and the Biotechnology Center.
--I will further propose a corporate social responsibility tax credit. This credit will encourage businesses to help neighborhood and other nonprofit organizations.
This total program will help keep Minnesota competitive with other states as it will get rid of serious obstacles to job growth. Let me make this last point clear: The goal behind this program is not just to get businesses to relocate in Minnesota. Research shows this kind of approach doesn't work well. Rather, the goal is to make certain that we don't have unnecessary disincentives to businesses starting here, coming here, growing here and staying here,

To fund this job climate program I will recommend that the 1 percent increase in the sales tax, that was passed last spring, be continued beyond its scheduled 1983 termination,
For my second initiative, I will propose legislation to significantly reform the basic funding formula for Minnesota school districts in order to assure greater equity and local discretion.
Our current system of school finance is not working well. It does not achieve the equity in educational opportunity that was hoped for when the program was put in place in 1971. Moreover, the current system limits local discretion too much.
I assure you that greater local discretion and improved equity are compatible goals.
In place of the grandfather revenue, declining enrollment revenue and the discretionary revenue programs, I will recommend legislation that will authorize local boards to obtain up to $400 per pupil unit in additional equalized revenue. This will be above the basic equalized foundation allowance. Besides this, school boards would be able to levy above this total if they chose.

The decision about what level of revenue to seek would be that of school boards--not the state.
I will propose that this new program be phased in over three years, starting with the 1983-84 school year.
I also will propose a program to eliminate as many mandates and regulations as possible. This will apply not only to schools, but to other programs as well.
Third, I will propose a series of changes that will improve the relationship between local governments and the state, as well as the relationship between local governments and the people they represent.
These changes recognize that state aid to localities must reflect actual, rather than projected, state revenue. Therefore, I will propose that all state aids dispensed to local governments and schools be paid out in a shared, prorated manner based on actual state revenues. That is, if state revenues are unexpectedly low, local and school aids will fall by that same margin, up to 5 percent of the appropriation. On the other hand, if state revenues are unexpectedly high, local and school aids will increase by the same margin, again by up to 5 percent.

My proposals recognize that our current property tax system is too confusing. Therefore, I will recommend that the homestead credit system be ended and that, instead, homestead property taxes be held down by lowering the portion of market value which is taxable. Taxes would be no higher in this new system than in the current system.
Agricultural property taxes would be held down in the same way by reducing the portion of market value which is taxable. This would make up for the elimination of the homestead credit and the agricultural mill rate credit.
My proposals also recognize that local residents need to understand the real costs of local services and that a useful tension should exist between taxpayers and local officials. Therefore, I will recommend that levy limits for cities, towns and counties, that are scheduled to be lifted in 1983, not be reinstated. Local communities and schools will be better able to decide for themselves how they should conduct their affairs.
Fourth, I will recommend a program to eliminate, now and in the future, unnecessary state mandates and regulations. vJe must free the hands of local officials to the greatest extent possible.
These changes will be made by statute and by departmental action.

To get off to a good start, I will recommend the immediate elimination or amendment of 16 state mandates.
I will recommend the creation of a permanent procedure for cataloging, analyzing and evaluating existing state mandates. The goal will be to remove and amend as many mandates as poss i b1e.
I will recommend that the Office of Local Government in the Department of Energy, Planning and Development be responsible for this job. I have chosen the Office of Local Government, rather than a new task force or commission, so as. to avoid the very duplication and red tape that we must excise.
And I will recommend that all proposed legislation affecting local governments, from this point on, clearly identify potential costs for communities.
Fifth, I will propose changes in PELRA that take into account our experience over the past year. PELRA, as amended in 1980, has produced over 50 strikes.
I will propose amendments in PELRA that will lead to more voluntary settlements and fewer strikes. This will be accomplished by strengthening the role of mediators in the collective bargaining process.

In addition, automatic time frames for strike legalization will be eliminated. This will encourage a greater degree of good.,.faith bargaining and will be fair to all concerned.
And I will propose that certain state hospital workers be given essential status similar to that covering local hospital workers.. This will ensure that mentally ill and other residents of our state institutions receive basic care without interruption,
Sixth, and last, I want to talk about saving lives. I will recommend specific, unflinching steps to get drinking drivers off the road, We must further 1ead the way in ending the nati on I,S amazing indifference to highway death and injury.
Almost seven out of 10 drivers killed in traffic accidents in Minnesota had been drinking beforehand.
I will propose legislation that will enable law enforcement officers to increase their arrests for drinking drivers and to insure that repeat offenders are dealt with more severely and more effectively,

Minnesota already has one of the best driving while intoxicated control systems in the country, and I thank the thousands of law enforcement officials who make it so, but we must do better.
Drivers must know that tough enforcement will become even tougher and that certain and immediate consequences will follow all drinking and driving offenses.
I will propose legislation that will broaden the authority of law enforcement officers to give alcohol tests to traffic violators. Any driver with an alcohol concentration of more than .05 will be considered impaired; and repeat drunken drivers who test .10 or higher will be charged with a gross misdemeanor. Strict enforcement and heavier penalties will be the rule, though we will not back off on our commitment to rehabilitation.
We must convince people that they have the deepest personal responsibility not to drive if they drink.
These, then are the proposals I will be presenting for your consideration this session. They're in keeping with principles of frugality and individual and local responsibility.
But let's look further into the future, beyond the constraints of this legislative session.

We must seek a society in which there are good jobs for everyone who is able to work.
We must seek a society in which communities are warm and neighbors are compassionate.
And we must seek a society in which families are strong, for their loving arms are the arms that hold the nation together.
These, of course, represent noble thoughts more than they do a plan for the future. All good things cannot be, and should not be, in the hands of governmental officials.
What we must expect from public officials is leadership in charting government's course.
The long-term changes I envision in public services are so fundamental that they can only take root outside of government.
As things now stand, government not only funds great numbers of programs, it also manages them. Why? How can we expect government to provide effective and efficient service if there are few alternatives?

Shouldn't people have a greater opportunity to shop around for the services they now receive?
Shouldn't the private sector be given greater opportunity to offer these services at a competitive price?
And shouldn't public officials have substantially more flexibility than they now have in carrying out welfare, sanitation, law enforcement and any number of other public services?
My answer to all these questions is absolutely yes.
For these things to happen, government must become less parochial, less self-protective, and less fearful of competing on the open market. But government cannot accomplish these changes alone, or even lead the way.
Leadership must come from the private sector. I stand ready to offer as much help and encouragement as I can in enabling creative people in the private sector to playa larger role in carrying out needed services that have been monopolized by government.
I also call upon individuals and groups to rethink, in the most fundamental way, the way in which we provide public services. We must make certain that good public services are not dependent on ever-increasing taxes.

Suggestions have been made recently in newspapers and elsewhere that such studies be made. I agree. I have asked Kent Eklund, Commissioner of Energy, Planning and Development, to convene a diverse group, from both in and out of government, to take a sharp look a,t Minnesota's future.
Ladies and gentlemen, these are difficult days.
They are difficult for political leaders who must make decisions that please no one.
They are difficult for employees, both public and private, who are afraid for their jobs.
And they are difficult days for those who foot the bill for government.
As we go about our work this session we must balance two, at times conflicting, goals.
We must provide exemplary public service for the people of Minnesota.
But at the same time, we must remember that these very same people--our neighbors and others who have chosen us to represent them--are in a financial corner, just as our state is.
I urge us to be responsive to their Wishes. Thank you.

Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices, Members of the 73rd State Legislature, Constitutional Officers, Governors, distinguished friends and fellow Minnesotans:
Let me first say a word of thanks to Governor Quie and his administration for their excellent cooperation during our transition period. The Governor and his staff did everything possible to help us in this hectic period between election and inauguration. Thank you very much, Governor.
I want to welcome Senator Dave Durenberger to these Chamber. He has worked in the office of a past governor and is well aware that our economic recovery will depend on federal -- as well as state actions. We look forward to working with him in establishing a strong state and federal partnership.
***
As the 36th governor of Minnesota, I am today performing my constitutional duty by bringing you a report on the "State of the State."
The state of our state is not good. But we are not here to dwell on problems. Rather, we are here to outline the steps that are needed to find solutions. I have no slogans for this speech -- no new deal, fair deal or square deal. But for those who want a capsule comment on where we are headed, let me suggest that the central goal of our administration will be economic recovery, and the basic method for achieving that goal will be a partnership between government and the people it serves.

I believe that creation of jobs and expansion of employment rests on these broad principles --
We must nurture the startup and growth of small business as the key to the economic and social revitalization of Minnesota. The economic health of our farm economy is vital. We already have the human, financial, technological and natural resources to achieve this revitalization, but these resources are not being utilized to their utmost. The only practical way of tapping these resources is a genuine and broad-based public-private partnership that includes business, government, education, labor, agriculture, churches and all other segments of influence in our society. All of us must head in the same direction. We need more than a quick-fix. We need improved productivity in the workplace. We need quality in education, particularly in languages, math, science and computers. We need a long-range plan to visualize where Minnesota is headed 5, 10 and 20 years down the road. Ladies and gentlemen of the Legislature, that is where we will begin today.
***
Let me talk first about the role of partnership in the process of economic recovery. The economic recovery of Minnesota requires a concerted and cooperative effort. It is the duty of this administration

to propose new solutions to the Legislature. It is the duty of the Legislature to review those ideas, alter or replace them if appropriate, and to enact them into law. It is our duty together to implement these new ideas.
What I am saying is remindful of another inaugural message by Governor Harold Stassen in 1939, when Minnesota was beginning to slowly edge out of the Great Depression. He spoke of cooperation and mutual respect. The words he used then are just as useful now. I quote Governor Stassen:
"It will be my policy in this message, and throughout this session of the Legislature, to respect your prerogative, to recognize the division of powers between the branches of government under the Constitution, and to ask you, frankly, for your help in reaching the objectives of our administration, and in fulfilling the desires of the people."
I intend to keep my list of proposals to you relatively short. I want you to know in advance that we will be concentrating on four key areas: Economic development, energy, agriculture and assistance to the needy.
I urgently request from you a genuine, open debate on these and other public policy issues. Take my proposals and air them fully. Hone them and perfect them. But let all the people of Minnesota see them debated and acted upon.
***
We should also look to others in addition to ourselves for new ideas.
I have been very pleased with the organizations and individuals who have submitted recommendations on ways to initiate our economic recovery. Business groups, organized labor, nonprofit organizations and

higher education have all set forth useful ideas for state initiatives. I urge you to consider them carefully.
I want to call your attention to the work of an individual seated here today. Last year Representative John Brandl published his proposal on "A Fiscal Agenda for Minnesota." He argued for substantial reform in the manner by which public services are delivered and the method used to finance them.
In his words, "The way out of our fiscal swamp is not a mere compromise between spending and taxing, but a bold revamping of the ways we spend and tax."
Representative Brandl's main points are: 1. We must protect those who are needy with basic education,
basic income and basic medical care. 2. We should provide money rather than services to the needy.
Government itself need not produce services if people have money to procure them elsewhere. 3. Institutionalized people should be returned to a normal environment whenever and wherever possible. 4. We should foster self-help rather than dependence on government. 5. We can charge people for public service. If citizens have the money to pay, then charging the cost of a service is an inducement to provide those services economically, and to provide only those services for which people are willing to pay. 6. Service providers, including those in government, should be held accountable.

Each of us could argue the merits of these ideas. But the point is, they are bold new directions. I am convinced that only bold new directions can solve our fiscal crisis, and I urge the Legislature to consider Representative Brandl's proposals as a starting point for this year's deliberations.
***
I have initiated the following steps to provide additional ideas on how best to work toward recovery:
First, within a few days we will be inviting all the former governors of Minnesota to a meeting at the Governor's residence. Each of these individuals is a special person, elected by Minnesotans to meet the particular needs of a particular time. Each has insights on what needs to be done and what can be done.
Second, I plan to establish a regular schedule of breakfast meetings with leaders of agriculture, business, education and labor. Together with government and the people of Minnesota, they will make our new partnership.
Third, last week I announced the appointment of Blue-Ribbon Economic Recovery Commissions in ten key growth sectors of the Minnesota economy. These groups will advise our administration on high technology, medical technology, tourism, agri-processing, wood products, minerals, film and graphic arts, international trade, banking and investment, and construction. I have asked these groups to bring me a fast track report by February 15 on how government can assist these key industries to grow and prosper.

Another special commission will make recommendations on what to do about our state planning functions. More than ever we need the capability to envision the Minnesota of the future.
Fourth, I have asked my staff and the commissioner of Finance to initiate a thorough review of the state budget. The recent special session of the Legislature forced us to delay our final budget planning by about three weeks, and I have asked your permission to submit my budget message on February 15.
***
Government will play a key role in the economic recovery partnership. Over the last three years we have asked state agencies,schools, and local government to absorb a substantial amount of budget cuts.
I would like to be able to tell you that the cutting is over, but I cannot. However, any additional reductions we make must be extremely selective.
We must try to consolidate governmental offices, agencies and institutions. We must also seek new options for providing public services.
State government reorganization is one way to make the delivery of services more efficient and cost-effective. Right now more than 30 agency heads report directly to me. Any good management plan would cut that number by one-half.
To start with, we are recommending a reorganization of the Commerce Department and a transfer of the Consumer Services function to the Office of the Attorney General. In addition, we are considering various options for the departments of Health, Public Welfare and Energy,

Planning and Development. I am also committed"to substantially reducing the number of direct gubernatorial appointments to boards and commissions.
I respectfully request that constitutional offices and the Judicial and Legislative branches undergo the same self-evaluation now underway in the Executive Branch. With respect to the Legislature, I urge you to consider whether 201 individuals are necessary to represent the people of Minnesota. I suggest you consider reducing the size of the Legislature, with the reduction to become effective after the 1990 census.
***
This process of self-evaluation cannot be limited to state government. Schools, cities, counties and towns must accelerate their efforts to streamline their operations.
In my Inaugural Address on Monday, I said I was deeply concerned that past budget cuts in education have fallen far too hard on classroom teachers and not hard enough on the administration of schools. I am concerned that the teaching of languages, math and science is slipping. Minnesota students must be in the forefront of computer knowledge both for their own benefit and for the benefit of Minnesota-based industries, which will need them as workers.
The lack of computer education will intensify the divisions between the haves and have-nots in our society. We cannot allow this to happen.

I intend to speak out repeatedly on the subject of education and repeat my warning that we cannot retreat to a narrow teaching of the three Rs in an age of computers and lasers. We cannot afford to send our students into ~ high tech society with ~ low tech education.
***
How we raise money to finance government also will affect our recovery. It is time to initiate a major reexamination of how we finance the operation of government. As you know so well, for the past three years we have cut budgets and raised taxes repeatedly, and we have been forced into the use of shifts. That must stop.
As Governor, I never used or threatened vetoes. My philosophy is to have an early warning system, letting legislative sponsors know that changes in certain bills would be urged. That system has worked well, and I believe I have a good working relationship with the Legislature.
But let me say here that I will use the veto, if necessary, to avoid further dependence on shifts as a way of balancing the state budget.
Let me say a few words about my philosophy on revenue raising. I will save the details for my February 15 Budget Message, but I want you to know that I will be seeking tax reforms leading to a system that is stable, equitable, and simple.
To help us assure a stable system, we must appropriate a reasonable budget reserve. We will be using conservative estimates in our budget projections. But even so, we must have a budget cushion large enough to protect against unanticipated economic downturns. I will include a specific proposal for a reserve in my Budget Message.

Over two-thirds of what now is called "state spending" does not go for what usually is thought to be "state government." Seventy cents of every dollar spent by the state is returned to schools, local governments or directly to individuals in the form of "transfer payments." It is money collected by the state but channeled directly back to citizens and their cities, counties, towns and schools.
In recent years we have run into trouble because we have promised more in these transfer payments than we have been able to deliver. Local governments have justifiably complained; their budget planning has suffered as a result.
In February I will be proposing to you a system whereby schools and local governments will be asked to share the risk of state revenue collections. If the state revenues fall below our conservative projections, then the governmental recipients of these aid payments should be expected to bear a proportionate reduction in payments.
Without this flexible aid formula for schools and local government, and without a budget reserve, the only alternative is a series of special legislative sessions. No one benefits from special sessions; I am committed to avoiding them.
***
As you know, our credit rating has suffered as we have turned increasingly to short-term borrowing because of cash flow problems. Clearly, that must end. We must join in taking all necessary steps to restore our credit rating to Triple-A and MIG-I.
***

Let me sum up my thoughts on fiscal matters. We must do more than merely cut budgets or raise taxes. We must reexamine both the size and nature of government expenditures. All levels of government must participate in this process, and all levels must share in the risk of economic down cycles. The state can no longer be looked to as the guarantor of aid levels to schools and cities.
***
Reducing the cost of government,' and making government more efficient, will help our economic recovery. But government can also play a positive role; it can be the source of new initiatives and a prime mover in our new partnership.
An example of an opportunity for a positive role for government is reducing the cost of workers' compensation insurance. I am asking you to deal with this issue - and to solve it - in the 1983 session. To help in this effort, we can refer to various studies recently completed.
I am convinced that we can reduce the cost of workers' compensation insurance to the employers of the state without impairing benefits for injured workers. ~By making the system more efficient and more equitable, and building in the proper incentives for both workers and employers, we can remove this barrier to economic recovery.
***
I will soon be sending you a number of additional new initiatives designed to help put Minnesotans back to work and to get our economy moving again. I call my philosophy for these new initiatives "investment budgeting." By that I mean we must concentrate our limited resources in

those sectors of the economy where state assistance can do the most good and where one dollar of state investment will yield many dollars in increased economic activity.
Tourism is an excellent example. I have made a commitment to increase our tourism budget to $6.2 million, about four times its present size. If past patterns hold true, that amount will produce over $100 million in new revenues for Minnesota businesses and workers.
I have asked Marlene Johnson, our new Lieutenant Governor, to spearhead this tourism initiative. I cannot tell you how proud I am to have Marlene. - the first woman Lieutenant Governor in the history of Minnesota - as a partner on our team.
We have other investment opportunities in the state, and I will give you more ideas on those in several weeks.
To fund these investments, we could use direct appropriations, sale of bonds, prudent use of invested funds; we could provide direct loans to businesses, loan guarantees, equity investments or participate in regional venture capital programs.
We'll be looking at dollar-stretching ideas -- leveraging state money to the maximum. We will look for prudent investments in ways that create opportunity and stimulate other investments. On January 24, I will deliver, to you, the investment budget with detailed recommendations.
***
We will not experience a full economic recovery until the depression on our farms has ended. Agriculture and related businesses are the backbone of the Minnesota economy. The current tragedy on our farms affects all of us, rural and city residents alike.

We have taken steps to resolve this problem, and I ask your help in searching for others.
To date, we have appointed a special trade representative for agriculture, we issued an Executive Order on the use of gasohol in state-owned vehicles, we have begun research on the full extent of farm mortgage foreclosures, and we are working with governors in eight nearby states on a minimum pricing bill.
***
Our economic recovery is also dependent on our ability to increase energy conservation programs and to develop alternative energy sources. Our climate and our lack of traditional fossil fuels pose a significant barrier to economic growth.
We must do more to weatherize our public buildings, residences and businesses. We must develop sources of alternative energy like peat, biomass, hydro, solar and wood residues. And we must provide incentives for the expansion of district heating systems.
Because energy is so important to our economic recovery, I will be delivering a separate message to the Legislature on that topic within several weeks.
***
Let me discuss our most pressing and most immediate need providing food, shelter and clothing for those Minnesotans who are out of work, and who have no other sources of support.

For too many Minnesotans, these are truly desperate times. While we speak of economic recovery in the future, they cry out for food and shelter now. Our churches, foundations, businesses, labor unions and individuals are struggling to meet the needs, but more must be done.
As Governor, I am in a unique position to bring together all of our state's major institutions to concentrate on this problem. Already I have instructed our state agencies to evaluate possible initiatives. We are looking into the possibility of using National Guard armories and other state facilities as possible shelters for the homeless this winter.
Even with our best efforts, government needs help to solve this pervasive problem. I am pleased at recent initiatives by the private sector. Within the past week, the McKnight Foundation, in partnership with the cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, announced a major grant program that will put over 600 Minnesotans to work in the private sector. I extend my deep appreciation to the Foundation and to the mayors of the cities who worked so hard to put that program together.
We Minnesotans who have a job, or some source of income, must do our part to help alleviate the suffering of others. Various communities in the state have begun volunteer programs to help meet the food, clothing and shelter needs of the unemployed. We can learn from these examples.
I am asking every mayor and county commissioner to consider how their community can institute a volunteer program and to work with us in state government and the private sector.
To those of you without jobs, this is my message: I know of your problems; I have been through similar experiences before. Do not give up hope.
I am making a personal and heartfelt commitment to do what I can to help.

***
Two years ago the Legislature limited eligibility for persons on general assistance. Able-bodied persons with marketable skills were denied benefits. At the time this was done, the economy was not in the condition we find it today.
Those who are able and willing to work are having extreme difficulty in finding a job. The Pot1ach Corporation had 130 job openings for a new wood products plant opening March 1st in Cook, Minnesota. They have been accepting applications for two weeks and already had over 8,000 inquiries.
We cannot continue to penalize those persons who are suffering as a result of bad economic conditions. Eligibility for general assistance must be expanded or we must find other ways to help those who have no other sources of assistance available to them.
In the coming weeks I want to harness the compassion, the energy and the ideas of all Minnesotans into the greatest self-help operation this state has ever seen. We are a strong people, and we are a caring people. And we are one people. Together we can get over this recession and plant the seeds for a strong economic future.
***
Much of what I have talked about today has emphasized the need for a partnership between the public and private sectors in Minnesota. I want to stress that point one more time. Churches and nonprofit organizations alone cannot feed the hungry or house the homeless. Business and labor alone cannot turn the economy around. Government alone cannot

restore our crumbling infrastructure. It takes a concerted effort - an effort based on mutual trust and a willingness to compromise.

today.

***
Let me sum up the eight major points I want to leave with you
1. The goal of our administration will be the economic recovery of Minnesota, and to achieve this goal we will rely on a strong partnership between government and the people it serves.
2. We must continue to reduce the cost of government by reevaluating how and why government taxes us and what it does with those tax revenues; we must look to government reorganization and consolidation as another way to reduce cost.
3. We must reform our tax system to make it more stable, more equitable and more simple.
4. We must better manage our state's finances: I will veto any further shifts, we will insist on a reasonable budget reserve, we will use conservative budget estimates, and we will reduce, to the extent possible, our reliance on short-term borrowing.
5. We will reevaluate the fiscal relationships between the state and our schools and local governments; the state can no longer be the guarantor of local finances.
6. We must maintain a forward-looking education system; we cannot afford to send our students into a high tech society with a low tech education.


7. We will do everything possible to create favorable opportunities for business growth in the state; we will recommend "investment budgeting" and we will strive hard for the passage of workers' compensation insurance reform.
8. And finally, we must not forget our duty to those Minnesotans who are out of work and without any sources of support.
I will close with these thoughts - we face a real crisis in the life of our state, because of the number of people out of work, and the problems of state revenues. Yet, I harbor the strong belief that in adversity people can be at their best.
This becomes clear when blizzards strike, like the one of last week. People did not despair, they pitched in and helped each other, and there was a bond that normally does not exist when times are good.
I hope that can happen, for however many months or years it takes, to pull us out of the economic "blizzard" we. are now experiencing.
We have seen this cooperative spirit before. It has been evident in bad times, and we recovered.
Columnist Walter Lippman once put it this way: "You took the good things for granted. Now you must earn them again. It is written: 'For every right that you cherish, you have a duty which you must fulfill. For every hope that you entertain, you have a task you must perform. For every good that you wish could happen .. You will have to sacrifice your comfort and ease. There is nothing for nothing any longer.'"
We have a lot to do. I need your help. Now let's get going! Thank you.

Mr. Speaker, mr. President, mr. Chief justice, members of the court, members of the legislature, constitutional officers, former governors and fellow Minnesotans.
It is my duty under the constitution to again report to you on the "state of the state." i want to share with you my perspective of where we have been . My sense of where we are and my vision of where we can go.
I am pleased to say that we can look back on a year of hard work and accomplishment.
The state of our state is much improved today from a year ago.
And i can also say that we can now look ahead with a sense of optimism, of confidence, that was not possible a year ago.
As a result, we can take hold of our destiny once again.
We can restore Minnesota to its place of greatness among our states.
We can shape a Minnesota that works not only for the rest of 1980s but also for the 1990s and beyond.
 


First, let's look back to one year ago.
We were reeling from one special legislative session to another. There were five special legislative sessions in one year prompted by our recurring budget crisis.
You in the legislature were forced to raise taxes and cut service .
We were desperately trying to prevent bankruptcy. One business
columnist was predicting that the state would be bankrupt by november i, 1983.
We were confronted by a massive financial deficit.
Our triple-a credit rating was gone.
Unemployment had gone beyond 10 percent.
The threat of farm foreclosures was running high, and food shelves were running low.
Minnesota - the state that worked - was sputtering.
Our people had lost confidence in their state government.
It was not a happy time for Minnesota.


We took office with no easy slogans, no quick fixes, but we did make one pledge: To make state government work again and to help put Minnesotans back to work, that promise has been kept,
 
when we came into office one year ago, i laid out two immediate goals for Minnesota:
Restore fiscal stability and put our people back to work, i am happy to report that we are doing well on both fronts, our budget is balanced and we paid off more than 500 million dollars in old bills, we are starting to get our good credit ratings back and there is money in the bank,
 


in place of a massive deficit, we have a solid budget reserve.

Minnesota, i'm proud to say, appears to be in the healthiest financial shape of any state in this country.

And i intend to keep it that way.

 

 

This past year in state government can be summed up in three words: Stability, credibility and dependability.

The credit for this impressive turnaround must be shared with the people of Minnesota, and with you, the members of the legislature.

It was your willingness to make the tough decisions last spring that put our fiscal house in order.

It was a team effort, and it worked.

Minnesota's economic recovery is strong, and our people are going back to work.

82,000 more Minnesotans are working today than one year ago.


Our unemployment rate has dropped from 10.4 percent last January to 6.8
percent. That's below the national average.
The job-creating programs, which you approved last session, are working well.
We have put more than 7,200 people to work on the emergency jobs
program.
The confidence of Minnesota business leaders was badly shaken by the fiscal nightmares of the past.
But our determination to provide fiscal stability and our determination to make government work has given renewed confidence to decision-makers in the business world.
 
They now see a state that balances its books that meets problems head on that insists on tough fiscal management.
And they have an administration that listens that cares . And keeps its promises.
 


One of the promises i made a year ago was to nurture a new era of cooperation in Minnesota involving labor, business, education, agriculture and government. I called it a new "partnership."
but lately i have been referring to it as our  Minnesota family" -made up of our diverse ethnic and economic groups -- a family whose members help each other through the tough times.
That idea -- whether you call it partnership or family -- is vital to the long-range economic health of our state.
We must build bridges -- not dig chasms -- between the segments of our society.
One of my first actions as governor was to appoint economic recovery commissions, bi-partisan in membership and chaired by some of Minnesota's more prominent citizens.
These volunteer commissions worked rapidly to produce recommendations . I accepted their recommendations and you enacted many of them into law.
The results have been impressive. From wood products to tourism to technology, we are seeing the benefits of this new spirit of cooperation.


Let me cite some of year's headlines:
Ford motor company announced a 250 million dollar expansions in st. Paul, one of the largest industrial expansions anywhere in the country.
Apache corporation decided to stay in Minnesota and expand.
IBM, one of our major employers, outlined a long-term growth program.
Eta systems selected st. Paul as its headquarters, assuring that Minnesota will be the super-computer of the world.
Louisiana pacific picked Minnesota over several other states for a new wood products plant.
Prudential announced plans to move a major division to Minneapolis,
adding some 1300 jobs.
H.B. Fuller company dedicated a 12 million dollar research and development center in vadnais heights .
And honeywell announced phase one of a three-part 43 million dollar
building expansion.
Whether it's sanborn manufacturing expanding in springfield .


I.D.A. Corporation growing in moorhead or the biosorb company moving from north dakota to Minnesota . The story is the same, wherever i go: Minnesota workers are among the most productive in the country. Let me give you a few more examples, watlow electric company has plants in illinois, iowa and west germany. They could have expanded in any of those places. Bur they chose to add hundreds of jobs in winona because of the quality of the workforce. Executives of ford motor company told me the same thing , so did thin film technologies of north mankato . And so did star technologies when they opened a research facility in brooklyn park.
 There are just a few examples, but they tell an important story: Minnesota has turned the corner and is on the move.


We have made a big start toward the major long-range goal of this administration:
To make Minnesota the best place to live work play . And .. The best place to do business.
 
But we cannot stop here. Our agenda remains full. And it will require more bridge-building . More pulling together as a Minnesota family.
Our first and foremost objective is to make Minnesota competitive with the rest of the country.
Some of our state taxes are too high and must be reduced. Our citizens are willing to pay for quality service, but they are paying too much today.
That's why my top priority for the 1984 legislative session is to cut taxes. I am proposing five immediate tax changes.
First, repeal of the 10 percent income surtax on july 1st. This will
put 230 million dollars into the pockets of Minnesota taxpayers over the
next 18 months.


Second, transfer of the motor vehicle excise tax into the highway construction fund, retroactive to last july 1st. This will pump an
additional 93 million dollars into highway construction and transit,
improving our transportation systems and putting people to work. It keeps a promise already made.
Third, repeal of the unitary tax on corporations, helping Minnesota firms in the world marketplace.
Fourth, adoption of several incentives to encourage our businesses to enter world markets. This will cost us little, but will send an important signal.
Fifth, repeal of the state's share of the estate tax. Easing the burden on our senior citizens, and encouraging our retired citizens to stay in Minnesota.
These changes are necessary and urgent to keep our economic momentum.
These reductions will set the steps for further and more comprehensive tax reform recommendations from the latimer tax study commission, which i appointed last year.


This bi-partisan commission will conduct a top-to-bottom review of our
tax structure, and make recommendations to the 1985 legislature. It will be the most thorough analysis of tax policy in 30 years, and it will position
Minnesota for economic leadership for generations to come.
Beyond these immediate tax-reducing proposals, my legislative program will be brief and to the point.
The most important objective will be to hold spending to an absolute minimum.
We have worked hard to put Minnesota back on its feet financially .
As part of our effort to make Minnesota a competitive leader in this country, we must continually re-examine our structure. We must prune reorganize and streamline. Our goal must always be to eliminate red tape and fat.
However, i must also point out that the number of non-faculty employees
on the state payroll has declined over the past 10 years. State employees
are doing a good job -- anyone who drives on clear highways within hours after a blizzard can testify to that.


As a means of prompting an on-going review of state government, i am
recommending that reforms be made in all three branches -- executive, legislative and judicial.
First, a citizen commission will report soon on some options relating to constitutional offices. Several elected officials have proposed such a review, and i believe the time is right for a constitutional amendment to be considered.
Second, i again strongly recommend that the legislature make a serious attempt to agree on a reduction in size. While i am not firmly committed to
a particular number, a house of 100 members and a senate of 50 seems to make
sense. If this change can be enacted, it should be written to take effect
for the 1992 elections, following the next census.
Third, a commission created by this legislature has recommended
unification of our county and district courts. I have appointed all 12
members of our new court of appeals, and that court has plunged into its work. It is time to have a court system of three levels -- no more.


These immediate actions:

Tax reduction, spending restraint, and reducing the size of government
will send a clear signal that Minnesota can respond positively and
aggressively to the needs of the 1980s and prepare itself for the 1990s.

 

 

One of the most difficult -- yet important -- problems you will face this session is revision of our unemployment compensation program.

In the past, we chose to borrow from the federal government rather than adopt a pay-as-you-go system. That is another overdue bill which must be paid.

Yet, business -- particularly small business -- needs relief. But we
cannot turn our backs on the unemployed worker who wants to work but cannot find a job.


A special commission with representation from both labor and management
is hard at work on this issue, and is making progress. This issue is too important to the workers and businesses of this state to become a political football. Here again, let us think of building bridges -- let us work together to find a permanent solution.
This issue -- and many of the issues we will deal with -- affect the small businesses of Minnesota. Most of them don't have public relations firms, and don't make flashy announcements when they open or expand. But
they provide 80 percent of the new jobs in Minnesota each year -- and their
voice must be heard.
 
This session of the legislature should be short and limited in scope.
You have my pledge of support to complete the session in six or seven weeks.
As always, i am always available to meet with members of the
legislature to facilitate the work of the 1984 session.
 
Here in Minnesota, i see 1984 as a turning point. We are poised to
move in new directions.


Thanks to the foresight of our leaders and the sacrifice of our citizens we have a fine education system 
Minnesota is known throughout the world for high technology 
we hold a pre-eminent position in medicine and health carel medical technology and tele-communications 
few other states can claim a stronger agricultural base, , ,
our record of nurturing small businesses is a strong one ,
and no other state has taken better care of its infrastructure i environment and quality of life.
 
So it's clear that the ingredients are all there for Minnesota to lead and profit from the economic revolution that's sweeping america.
We must inventory our strengths and capitalize on them , ,
we must identify our weaknesses and correct them 
and above all we must have the courage and foresight to turn from the past and embrace the future, we cannot afford the luxury of looking only to
next month or next year, we must anticipate and plan for 1990 and beyond,


in the next few weeks, 11 members of my administration will be reporting in detail on long-range plans for Minnesota. I want these speeches and messages to be viewed as follow-ups to this "state of the state" message.
They will cover education, the environment, regulation and de-regulation and a variety of other subjects. I hope you will find this system a useful departure from the past.
In the few minutes remaining i would like to underscore some of the highlights . .
Pivotal to our future is the overhaul and modernization of our tax structure -- and the streamlining of government -- to give Minnesota the competitive edge in this country. We have taken steps to reduce the cost of workers compensation and we will act to reduce other costs of doing business.
Minnesota will be a state that means business.
 
Education is the flagship of our future


we must view education in global terms . With particular emphasis on mathematics, science, languages and technology.
We must encourage the work of our gifted and talented young people.
And, we must support our colleges and universities in their efforts to expand partnerships with business and industry.
This demands investments in education priorities at all levels.
Many commissions -- both in government and in the private sector -- are studying our educational system. This is good.
We must always look to retaining traditional values in education, but we cannot be afraid to discard old methods when new ones are better.
We must look to new generations of computers and other technologies, but we also must look to new emphasis on arts, music and foreign languages in our schools.
We must soften the hard edges of technology with the songs, poetry and literature of the ages.


Nothing will enhance the future strength of this state more than energy self-sufficiency -- a priority that i have repeatedly stressed for this
administration. We are currently paying over 7 billion dollars a year for our energy needs. And more than half of this 7 billion dollars is leaving
our state to enrich other parts of the world.
That's why we must develop our state's own energy resources. We must keep our energy dollars . And the jobs they provide . At home in Minnesota.
 
Minnesota is now positioned to move aggressively into international marketing.
Many of the great multi-national corporations are headquartered here . .
We have a first-class trade office . .
And the development of the world trade center will make Minnesota the hub of international activity in the midwest.
To solidify our leadership position, i would like to see a graduate school of international business added to one of our colleges or universities.
 


One of the great tragedies of our time is that the ability of american farmers to produce is turned into surpluses . Rather than food for the hungry.
Despite modest increases in grain prices, we still have hard times -perhaps even a depression -- in our farm economy.
That is not something to be shunted aside, because agriculture accounts for 40 percent of Minnesota's economy.
Our goal is to work with farm leaders and the agri-processing industry
to open new markets in 1984. We can add value to farm products by
processing them in Minnesota.
We need better promotion -- Minnesota potatoes need not take a back seat to those from idaho. Minnesota cheese matches that made in wisconsin. Our apples are as tasty as those grown in washington.
Our agriculture department has begun a  Minnesota grown" promotion effort, and i endorse it fully.
 
No state has done a better job of protecting its environment and that effort was recognized a few weeks ago.


A four-year study by the conservation foundation ranked Minnesota first among the 50 states in efforts to protect the environment. That's a ranking we don't want to lose.
Just as important -- the study found that a state does not have to weaken its environmental regulations to attract jobs and industry.
That vigilance will continue.
We can get rid of mountains of old tires, old railroad ties, auto junkyards, solid waste dumps -- and anything else that is a blight on our environment.
We will scrub Minnesota clean.
We must launch a major program to upgrade sewage treatment plants throughout Minnesota. Along with protecting our waters, a strong wastewater treatment system is necessary for industrial expansion.
One of the follow-up messages will deal with our efforts to combat acid rain, Minnesota should be a leader in this effort. We recognized the problem early, and we brought it to national attention.
I intend to make acid rain a major and continuing topic in the national governors' association.
 


Thanks to your courageous votes last session, we have already begun the long process of rebuilding and repairing Minnesota's critical road, highway and bridge network.
Even while that is underway, we should develop a light rail transit system in the metropolitan area to remove some traffic from our increasingly crowded streets and freeways.
 
Minnesota stands to gain more from tourism than most states . .
And thanks to actions of this legislature, we now have a greatly expanded promotion program underway. Inquiries to our tourism office are up by more than 25 percent.
1983 was a good year for our resort and hospitality industry, and 1984 should be even better.
Let me interject at this point a suggestion that we deal with several gaming issues this year -- and put them behind us. Questions of a lottery, greyhound racing and expanded bingo are public policy issues that deserve open, public debate. But they need not consume our interest for year after year.
 


Sports and the arts are not only good for the body and spirit, , , they are good for the state's economy.
We must do more to build private and public support for the arts , .
And we are going all-out to promote a successful, comprehensive sports program with the best major league and college teams in the country. Minnesota deserves the best.
I plan to appoint another citizens commission to study how we may better nurture the arts in Minnesota.
Our music, art and literature can link us to foreign lands.
As i told the Minnesota education association last winter, we live in a world with a multiplicity of languages, many religions and different forms of government. Art is the common denominator, the universal language.
 
In this time of changing priorities and austere budgets . .
We should not, and we shall not, ..
Abandon our commitment to those who need help the most . ,


the handicapped . The elderly .. The poor and the unemployed minorities who are victims of discrimination and women who are underpaid solely because they are women.
Minnesota's compassion for those in need will be maintained.
 
Minnesota's future will be greatly enhanced by our ability to forge strong working relationships with other states, particularly those in the midwest.
For that reason, i have accepted assignments as chairman of the midwest governors' conference, and as a member of the executive committee of the national governors' association.
Tomorrow we open the second session of the Minnesota-wisconsin dialogue to discuss joint efforts in pollution control, acid rain, international trade, education and resource development.
We will soon undertake similar discussions with south dakota and iowa.
And later this week, we host a meeting of the northeastern and midwestern states on the subject of energy.
 


In closing, i want to thank the legislature and the people of Minnesota for helping to turn the state around and put it firmly on course.
Minnesota is on the move . .
Strategically poised in the leadership position as the nation's economic transformation accelerates.
Our goal is to make this state the best place in the country to live and work and play and do business.
We have made great progress, but we have much more work ahead.
There are far too many Minnesotans who want a job and cannot find one.
Our tax burden is too high and must be reduced.
Our educational system, the heart of our future, must be improved.
We must make government work more efficiently and at lower cost for the benefit of our citizens.


He face some very important challenges for 1984. But i want us to look
even farther ahead than that. As i learned during my recent years in
business, you can't judge results in a few months or even a year. We have
to look to the kind of Minnesota we want for the rest of the 1980s and for
the decades which lie beyond. This is my goal:
To position Minnesota for greatness in a rapidly changing world. It is why i have placed much emphasis on my own personal travel and upon international trade.
I see it as the future, and we must capitalize on that future.
I am convinced that Minnesota can become one of the great centers of culture and commerce, of education and opportunity, of sports and recreation . A mecca where citizens from all backgrounds and all pursuits can live and work effectively together . Beacon of success and opportunity for the nation and the world.
This is a great challenge and a worthy goal.
I invite you to join with me in striving toward it.
Thank you.
Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, Mr. Chief Justice, members of the court, constitutional officers, members of the Legislature and my fellow Minnesotans.
Two years ago I began this address by stating that the central goal of this administration would be job creation and economic recovery, achieved through a partnership between the public and private sectors.
I am pleased to report to you that we have made giant strides toward this goal. The state of the state is greatly improved and getting better.
Two years ago Minnesota's unemployment rate stood at an all-time high.
216,000 of our people were out of work.
The Legislature had staggered through six special sessions, raising taxes, shifting spending and cutting services.
Minnesota's valued triple-A credit rating had been lost, and another deficit was looming on the horizon.
Our state faced the most severe financial crisis in its history.
 
In contrast today...

***

There are more than 170,000 additional Minnesotans employed.

In fact, there are 57,800 more people working now than ever before in the history of our state. For the year ending in October, Minnesota ranked second nationally in total employment gains.

Our state's bank account is in the black instead of the
red . . .

We are re-gaining our top credit ratings

We have a surplus in place of a deficit

And this month we shall payoff our last outstanding loan.

The turn-around has been one of the most dramatic and impressive in the nation.

***
In the past two years, we joined together a family unified by stress and we found our way.

 
We've helped each other we've reached out with

compassion to those in need

and we've restored

confidence and pride in our great state.

To each of you who helped during these difficult days thank you from the bottom of my heart.

I am grateful for your assistance, I am proud of your effort, and I am honored to be your Governor.

Special thanks go to you, the members of the legislature, for helping us make the difficult but necessary decisions.

New leaders have been chosen for this session of the Legislature, and I look forward to working with you.

For the first time in our state's history, a woman

Connie Levi

is the majority leader of the House of

Representatives in Minnesota. I congratulate you, Connie,

and I wish you well.

***
Now we turn our attention to the future, determined to build Minnesota to a position of strength in 1985 and the years ahead.

 
The challenge for the 1980s and 90s is to achieve vigorous, sustainable economic growth in rapidly changing times.
And I'm convinced that the state which will lead the nation is the one that best develops and harnesses the talents, energies and ingenuity of its people.
Minnesota has a natural advantage with well-educated, productive people. We must capitalize on our strengths.
The key to Minnesota's success lies in our ability to adapt this state to a nation and world of profound change. We must embrace change, and shape it, to meet tomorrow on our terms.
If we prepare for change. Minnesota will do well. Minnesota will do well because knowledge will be the steel of this post-industrial economy. Minnesota has the potential to become the number one brainpower state in the nation.
And believe me, we will be the brainpower state in the nation.
 
The path to permanent prosperity in Minnesota will require bold leadership and courageous legislative action to make our state more productive and competitive.

We must move decisively on four major fronts.

First we must reduce personal income taxes and simplify our tax forms.

Second we must control spending and guarantee fiscal stability.

Third we must strengthen our educational system.

Fourth we must accelerate our efforts in economic development and international trade.

All of these actions are aimed at one main strategy;

To create jobs quality jobs Minnesotans, now and in the future.

for all

***
Our first priority our first action must be a major reduction in personal income taxes.

 
My plan will save Minnesotans 604 million dollars, and will drop our maximum tax rate from sixteen percent to nine-point-nine percent.
For a family of four with one wage earner making 15,000 dollars a year Minnesota now ranks number one among all 50 states.
This tax cut will drop us to number 18 in that category. That makes me very happy I'm sure it does you too.
And for the first time in many years, Minnesota will no longer rank number one in any personal income tax category.
Were it not for the severe economic hardship in parts of Minnesota, we could make significantly larger tax reductions. However, we will not turn our backs on the thousands of Minnesotans who desperately need our help.
***
Along with this major tax cut, we must drastically simplify our tax forms.
I don't have to remind you what a hassle it is each year to fill out this tax form.
 
It's three pages long contains 32 pages of instructions and requires you to fill in over 100 spaces. It's a taxpayer's nightmare to say the least.
Under our plan you will have a simple one-page form.
It will haver only 16 lines, and it should take most of us less than 15 minutes to complete the form.
Minnesotans want, need and deserve tax reduction and simplification.
So I am appealing to the legislature to to make this tax reduction retroactive to January first of this year.
***
Our second major priority is spending control and fiscal stability. Stability means a strong state savings account, a budget reserve, a rainy day fund.
It goes by many names, but it means one thing -- an insurance policy against bad times, a guarantee that Minnesota will never again go through the financial chaos of a few years ago.
 
The reserve should be increased to 500 million dollars. I have a surprise for you. We have the money in the bank already. Just don't spend it.
An adequate reserve means we can pay our bills, make payments to local governments on time, and regain our triple-A credit rating.
Having a budgeted reserve is good, sound business practice and I am determined to get it enacted.
****
A strong budget reserve must be coupled with controls on state spending. Our budget team, under the direction of Finance Commissioner Donhowe, has spent nearly six months analyzing every conceivable way to cut the growth of government spending.
Thanks to their work, the budget which I will submit holds average spending increases to less than six percent a year, the smallest percentage increase in state spending in 20 years.
I can assure you that this budget contains only the most essential elements to provide quality services to our people.
 
I am determined to give Minnesota a national reputation for excellent fiscal management. My department heads will be judged by their ability to reduce spending and streamline state government. Our over-riding objective shall be to deliver quality services to the people of Minnesota as efficiently as possible.

We have proven that government can be lean without being mean.

It is my hope that by the time I leave the Office of

Governor, our state will be run with such efficiency

and such foresight

 that stockholders throughout the

United States will ask "Why can't business be run like

government in Minnesota."

On this issue, the federal government should take lessons from Minnesota.

Had Washington operated like Minnesota for the past two years, the federal government might be operating in the black instead of the red.

Unfortunately Washington doesn't have the discipline or ability to control spending.

 
The federal deficit is retarding the economic vitality of this country, and it must be brought under control.
I am announcing my support of a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced federal budget.
This is a dramatic step, but it must be taken.
Minnesota and other states are required to balance their budgets and I ask you, why not the federal government?
****
Positioning Minnesota for a dynamic future also requires investment. Investment to stimulate growth and create jobs investment in economic development and international trade.
There's a line from the broadway play liThe Music Man" about a traveling salesman. "You've got to know the territory."
Our territory in 1985 and beyond will be the world -- not just Minnesota, not just the Midwest, not just America -- but the world.
If you are a teacher you will be teaching more about other countries.
 
If you are a business person you will be learning more about exporting.

If you are a worker you will be looking at how your counterpart in another country does the job.

If you are a parent you will see your children

traveling more, 

learning more languages and

working in different parts of the world.

You will see that your children have opportunities which you and your parents never dreamed were possible.

Our state government must move forward with the rest of the world.

We must know the territory.

Where would the Japanese be today if they had stayed home?

Or more importantly, where would our steel industry be today if American steel executives -- rather than remaining complacent -- had decided to get to know the territory and make the world their marketplace?

We, not the Japanese, should be controlling the world steel markets.

 
Japan is not rich in natural resources. It imports

99 percent of its iron ore. 80 percent of its coal

 99 percent of its oil

 60 percent of its timber

and about one third of its food.

Yet, each year it records trade surpluses in the billions of dollars.

Japan is a world leader in consumer electronics, watches, motorcycles, cameras, automobiles and steel production.

Japan has succeeded because it strived in every way to become competitive. It developed and utilized technology. and then it headed around the world to sell its products and make investments.

We in Minnesota are following Japan's example. opening a bigger market for Minnesota's products, services and technologies.

It makes sense for us to do this because, Foreign trade is the wave of the future, and Minnesota must be ahead of the rest of the country. We must prepare now for the time when the value of the dollar is more realistic, and American products will once again be competitive in world markets.

 
International trade means expanded business for Minnesota, and business expansion, of course, means more jobs for Minnesota workers.
I will travel and continue to travel to any community in this state, any city in this nation, any corner of the world to bring jobs to Minnesota.
We must remember that Minnesota works best when its people are at work.
****
Jobs for tomorrow depend upon education and training today, which is our other major priority to position Minnesota for the future.
Education is the fuel that drives the engine of economic growth and job creation in America's modern society.
Minnesota has a head start here thanks to the long-standing support of public and private education by our people.
Our education system at all levels is one of the best in the country. But we must and we shall .. do better.
 
Last week I announced a bold, new plan for elementary and secondary education. A plan for access to excellence. This is a plan which ensures that all Minnesotans can participate in determining the highest quality of education for our young people.
Access to excellence will clarify the role of the state strengthen local control increase the
productivity of our students and allow parents and students to make decisions about the quality of education.
This is a plan which allows our young people to realize their full potential and to enjoy the brightest future possible.
In less than three weeks, I will submit a budget which significantly increases support to our post-secondary schools. About one-fifth of our budget will be invested in post-secondary education.
We need a strong vocational-technical system to support the workforce needs of our businesses.
We need a strong community college system to provide life-long learning opportunities for all citizens.
 
We need a strong state university system to educate our young people and to serve the economic development of our regions.
And we need a university which is strong, and world renowned for its graduate programs and research. We have a choice. We can be mediocre or we can be the best. I am sure that we in Minnesota want the best.
I want all Minnesotans to have access to the highest-quality education.
Education for me and many of my generation was a passport out of poverty.
Education for my children and yours will be a passport to prosperity.
Minnesota will become known throughout America and the world as the brainpower state.
Our brainpower will fuel the information-based and technology-based industries already flourishing in our state. It will give rise to new enterprises new ideas and new technologies which can be marketed around the world.

****
These major legislative actions will sustain our momentum and position Minnesota for a strong future.
Mr. Speaker, Mr. President . I view this 1985 session not only as the midpoint of the 1980s, but literally as the turning point for our state.
***
While I am pleased by the progress we have made and while I see many signs for optimism . . I am greatly disturbed by what I see happening in much of rural Minnesota.
It is increasingly apparent that Minnesota is becoming a two-economy state, with prosperity in the metropolitan area and depression in many rural parts of Minnesota.
Although there are now 57,800 more Minnesotans working than ever before in our state's history . . that is no consolation to the steel workers on the Iron Range, to the wood workers in International Falls, to the implement dealers in Dawson or the farmers in Fairmont.
The farm crisis and the severe problems of structural unemployment will require a massive, bipartisan effort that
 
includes a major commitment from Washington. The problem goes far beyond our control. The state can help and we will . . but our Senators and Congressmen must work with us. As a nation pulls together in time of crisis, our state must pUll together in this time of economic disaster in rural Minnesota.
I want to work with all of you in developing permanent, long-term solutions for our economically depressed areas.
To those people .hard-working people whose lives are being devastated .to all who may feel this despair
 let me say that I know from personal experience the heartache you are going through.
I can remember my days growing up in Carson Lake a small mining town on the Iron Range. When my father's lunch box was on the shelf, it meant no work, no income for our family.
I know what it's like to need a job and not have one. I know what it's like to face the loss of home and community, since my hometown of Carson Lake is gone forever.
I want you to know that I will not rest in my efforts until all Minnesotans share in our improving economy.
 
I want you to know, also, that I am committed to making

Minnesota benefit, not suffer, 

from the changes

that are sweeping America and the world.

Resisting change is a losing battle. Shaping change is the real challenge. And accepting change can mean new opportunities.

Many times in my own life I have learned this lesson.

When I was five years old . . . a first generation

American who couldn't speak English,

dedicated

teachers taught me the English language and opened a window

on the world.

Many years later, I suffered the deep personal disappointment that follows a political defeat.

You could not have convinced me that any good could come

from that. But,

in fact, it was a bright, new

beginning.

Again, the world opened up. I learned much more about business, international trade, the arts, the cultures of other people. And I developed a closer bond with my own family.

 
I returned to the Office of the Governor with a new perspective a broader view a clearer vision of what Minnesota can be.

And I entered the job with a new enthusiasm for the state and the people I love.

It's an enthusiasm I believe that flows from a special Minnesota spirit.

A spirit that we saw this holiday season when empty food shelves were filled to overflowing once the call for help went out.

It's a spirit that captures the attention of national observers such as Neil Peirce who, in his Book Of America: Inside The 50 States, he said:

"Search America from sea to sea and you will not find as close a model to the ideal of the successful society as Minnesota."

As we look ahead to the 21st century, just 15

years away

 it occurs to me that we are all immigrants

sailing to a new land.

The technological language and culture of tomorrow are unknown to us today. But I am hopeful as I was when I


first began to learn English as a second language that our voyage into the future will be successful.

By nurturing our sense of family by continuing

our spirit of cooperation by adopting common goals 

by preparing for change

 we can reach our goal.

We can make Minnesota productive and competitive . . and meet the future on our own terms.

Thank you very much.
Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Court, Constitutional Officers, Members of the Legislature, former governors and my fellow Minnesotans.
I can report tonight that the state of our state is sound.
We have overcome major adversities, we are meeting remaining problems boldly, and we are placing Minnesota squarely on course for a stable and prosperous future.
Minnesota is a remarkable state. Minnesotans are exceptional people. And I am deeply grateful and honored for the opportunity to serve longer than any other governor in the history of this state.
The hurdles ahead are great. But the opportunities are even greater. And the special Minnesota spirit is poised for the challenges we face together.
Our objective in the next four years is to bring out the best in Minnesotans to ensure opportunity for our children.
The five-year-olds who enter kindergarten next fall will graduate from high school in the year 2000. We must be sure that all of them have quality job opportunities.
Our goal is to make Minnesota a model state, to make Minnesota the brainpower state, to make Minnesota a world renowned research center.
To meet these objectives, we must focus our efforts in three key areas.
We must have a tax system that is competitive, honest, fair and simple, an education system that is committed to excellence, and a climate of research that will yield the products, ideas and jobs of the future.
Our future extends beyond terms of public office.
We must use our terms of office to shape our vision for the Minnesota of the 21st century.
It was 24 years ago this week that I first took the oath of office as a state senator and began my service to the state of Minnesota. Only one other individual who was here then, still serves today -- Representative Willard Munger -- Mr. Environment.
Representative Munger and I know how long the debate on Minnesota's business climate has raged.

For more than a quarter of a century, we have heard that Minnesota taxes are too high, and that the Minnesota business climate is bad.
I remember well three years ago when I met with a group of Norwegian business executives in Oslo who spoke at some length in negative terms about our business climate, and the perception of Minnesota as a high-tax state has hampered our ability to attract and create more much-needed jobs.
When I took office as governor in 1983, Minnesotans paid more income taxes than citizens of almost every other state.
We took dramatic action over the past four years, including a 25 percent cut in our income taxes, the largest cut of any state in the union.
But more must be done. We must harness the momentum of federal tax reform to initiate a major overhaul of our entire tax system.
This year we will propose the most sweeping reform in the history of this state.
Our tax plan will be the fairest and most thoughtful of any state in the nation this year.
First we will respond to the new federal law by returning the entire state windfall to the taxpayers of Minnesota.
In addition, 125,000 Minnesota low income families will no lo~ger have any state tax liability.
We will also streamline our tax forms.
Our short form will have only five lines. In fact, most people can do it in less than five minutes.
And our long form will be a single page.
Two-thirds of all taxpayers will be able to use the short form.
We will achieve a dramatic reduction in income tax rates.
When I took office in 1983, our top rate on the income tax was nearly 18 percent.
Under our new plan, we will cut that top rate by more than one-half to 8 percent, and we will also have a 6 percent rate for lower incomes.
Our personal income tax will be the fairest and most thoughtful of any state in the nation.

We will apply the same philosophy to our corporate tax.
I am particularly excited about our plan for property taxes and local government aids.
We will greatly simplify our system, which is now the most complicated in the nation.
We will reduce the number of property tax classifications from 68 to 6.
A key element of our program will be to increase the share of state funding for education, which is the cornerstone of our plan for the future.
I propose that the state assume a substantial share of school costs which are now paid for by property taxes.
Our property tax plan, like our income tax plan, will be the fairest and most thoughtful in the nation.
We will apply the same principles of fairness and thoughtfulness to sales tax reform, without taxing food, clothing, services or prescription drugs.
Overall our tax program has several themes: rate reduction, simplification, and fairness.
No longer will Minnesota tax rates be in the top ten in any major tax categories.
I want to repeat that no longer will Minnesota tax rates be in the top ten in any major tax categories.
We will create a better environment for job growth. And from this day forward we will focus all of our energy and ideas on making life better for those who need help most: our beleaguered farmers, our dislocated miners, and the jobless in our cities.
It is a long-standing and unique Minnesota tradition to form partnerships for the benefit of all.
Most recently we saw this Minnesota spirit in a group of people who reached a remarkable consensus on reform of our schools.
The Governor's Discussion Group brought together people with diverse points of view, but a common goal of making ed~cation in Minnesota the best.
This group understood the importance of making Minnesota the brainpower state, and that brainpower is the wellspring of future economic growth.

We will draw from the group's recommendations to make our K-12 education system the best in this nation.
In higher education, we will continue progress toward making' the University of Minnesota a world-class university, one of the top five universities in the nation.
In January 1985, we asked university officials to focus their mission, and they answered with an excellent plan.
The state, in turn, responded with increased funds for faculty salaries, research and financial aid for students.
It is critical that we continue to support the University's efforts as we did in 1985.
The state university system also has moved to clarify its role, and will become the major provider of undergraduate education.
Our state universities will increasingly become regional economic development centers in greater Minnesota, serving as catalysts for long-term economic growth and vitality.
Our community colleges and our AVTI system have more clearly defined their strengths through recent mission statements.
Graduating from a Minnesota AVTI has proven to be a sure-fire way to a job.
In the future, our AVTIs will play an increasingly important role in creating a better future for the working poor, for victims of major economic declines, and for many Minnesotans who seek training and retraining to provide for their families in the years to corne.
The AVTIs in Minnesota are the best in the nation. I am very very proud of them, and I wish each and everyone of you would applaud that system.
Excellent education will pave the way out of adversity for the most dependent Minnesotans.
This will represent real welfare reform.
I am asking the 1987 Legislature to join with me in establishing a goal that I believe is vital to our future as a state.
By the year 2000, I propose that 50 percent of the workforce in Minnesota will have an education two years beyond high school, and that 35 percent will have completed at least four years of college.

Minnesota already has the best high school completion rate of any state, and I propose we set the same goal for higher education.
Our third key area of emphasis must be research, research which will provide the tools of the future and the jobs of tomorrow.
Research and development leading to job creation will offer the best hope for areas of our. state which have been devastated by the changing economics of a nation and world.
The centerpiece of our research and development enterprise will be the Greater Minnesota Corporation, a public private organization that will spearhead the long-term economic recovery of rural Minnesota.
The Greater Minnesota Corporation will work hand-in-hand with colleges and universities throughout the state to translate research into business development and job creation.
Research will be the catalyst for economic diversification in the future as it has been in the past.
Taconite mining research conducted by Dr. Edward Davis over three decades at the University of Minnesota paved the way in the 1950s for a whole new industry for the Iron Range.
In the early 1900s, experiments in manufacturing sandpaper were conducted by a small company in Two Harbors, Minnesota.
This was the beginning of 3M, today a multinational corporation which makes more than forty thousand products and is our state's largest industrial employer.
3M's unrelenting commitment to research has spawned job opportunities throughout Minnesota and throughout the world.
Many new jobs have resulted from major medical advancements that occurred here in Minnesota.
Medtronic and its pacemaker -- which has provided a new lease on life for people throughout the world -- took shape in Earl Bakken's garage about forty years ago.
Advanced surgical techniques and devices to aid the hearing impaired are other examples of research-driven developments that have improved human life and have created new jobs.
Today, state government is in partnership with the University of Minnesota and private business interests to encourage more breakthroughs that will result in new jobs.
Together, we have established the Technology Corridor, the Supercomputer Institute and of course, the biotechnology center.
We have also invested in applied research efforts at Southwest State University to improve the economy of that region.

With all of our accomplishments in research and development, Minnesota must continue to invest in these activities or we will fall behind.
In the year 2000 Minnesotans will live in an economy rich with new ideas, new products and new jobs.
Minnesota will become a world-renowned research center.
Minnesotans have the abilities to meet these goals.
It has been proven time and again that prosperity does not depend on geographic size, location or climate. Nor does it rely on an abundance of energy fuels or other natural resources.
The key is people, our most important resource.
On opposite sides of the world, we have examples of two small nations, Finland and Japan, where people have made a difference.
Finland is similar to Minnesota in climate, its lack of energy resources and its distance from major economic hubs.
Yet this small nation has the 11th best per capita income in the world. It hasn't had a major economic recession since the end of World War II.
Japan is smaller in geographic size than four of our states, has half of the population of the United States, and virtually no petroleum, iron ore, coal or other mineral resources.
Nevertheless, Japan each year has trade surpluses in the billions of dollars, while the exports of much larger nations lag behind.
Minnesota is the only northern state from Pennsylvania to the west coast that experienced economic growth in the past four years.
Japan, Finland, and Minnesota all are places where industrious people made the difference.
So in closing tonight, I want to cite one illustration of the immense human resources of our state.
During the recent around-the-world flight of the Voyager, there were numerous references made to an earlier aviation feat.
Sixty years ago this May, Charles Lindbergh--whose character was forged in a small Minnesota town---stretched the horizons of human achievement in space, when his plane touched down in Paris after a 33-hour flight across the Atlantic.
Charles Lindbergh exemplified the loneliness of leadership, the daring of discovery, and best of the human
it.

He called his plane "The Spirit of St. Louis," but his heart beat with the spirit of Minnesota.
Minnesotans have led journeys of discovery, journeys of learning, and journeys of love.
Minnesotans have proven to be thinkers, leaders, creators and doers.
Let us continue to think, to lead, to create, and to do.
Along with you, I love this state, and I love its people.
Tonight we stand, side by side, as a family on the threshold of the 21st century. We are challenged by those who have blazed the trail before us. This is the pioneering leadership which is the best of Minnesota.
Tonight, I have spoken of three priorities which will move Minnesota forward -- tax reform, education, and a major investment in research.
We must forge our own future.
Minnesota, the model state, Minnesota, the brainpower state, Minnesota, the world-renowned research center.
Minnesota will be-ready for the challenge of the 21st century.
We are limited only by our skills, our determination, and our imagination.
Thank you and good night.Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Court, Constitutional Officers, Members of the Legislature, and my fellow Minnesotans:
Five years ago I stood before you as a newly elected governor and told you that the state of our state was not good. My message at that time was basic - we needed to form partnerships, create jobs and balance our budget. I also said that Minnesota needed a long-range plan to see where we were headed five, ten and twenty years down the road.
We are now five years down that road. Tonight I stand before you to report that the state of our state is good and will continue to get better. We have paid off our debts by forming the partnerships that have put 306,000 people back to work. I'm really proud of that. And we have a longrange plan - a blueprint for job creation ~ to carry us into the 21st century on the strength of brainpower.
Our blueprint is faithful to Minnesota's heritage of action through partnerships. It does not include any quick fixes or free rides. It concentrates on hard work, homework, teamwork and - above all - meaningful work for every Minnesotan.
We are moving ahead with the blueprint on four main fronts.
First, we are improving our system of educational excellence so that our children can become the most creative and talented workforce in the world.
Second, we are expanding our applied research and development programs to transform fresh ideas from the classrooms into high technology jobs for our economy.
Third, we are reforming our tax system and" making our government services more efficient. We are balancing our taxing and spending so that our businesses are profitable and all of our people are given the opportunities that they deserve.

And fourth, we are continuing Minnesota's tradition of strong environmental protection that is so basic to our health and quality of life.
Already, this blueprint for job creation has helped us to act before we have to react. We have replaced budget deficits with a budget reserve that insures us against financial uncertainty. We have dropped Minnesota's tax rate out of the top 10 in every category of personal income tax. After years of being in debt, our Unemployment Compensation Fund is at $145,000,000. Our unemployment tax rate is down to twenty-first in the nation and is lower than three of our neighboring states.
The main reason for this improvement is that we have put people back to work. In the past year alone we created over 70,000 jobs in Minnesota. Over one-half of those jobs, I'm very happy to report to you, were created in Greater Minnesota.
And we have saved jobs, by tackling the tough issues during the most difficult times.
In the midst of the farm crisis we created the first - and the best - farm mediation program in the country. It helped thousands of Minnesota farmers to survive and reap last fall's record harvests. When the federal government saw that Minnesota had the lowest rate of farm bankruptcies among agricultural states, they adopted our mediation program as a national model.

Our share of the national jobs in wood products jumped from 7 percent to 14 percent and our use of wood fuel saved Minnesota consumers $740,000,000.
As we rebuild farming, mining and wood products, our job growth continues in the high
. technology industries such as computers and health care.
It adds up to a strong, robust economy throughout Minnesota.
But there is still plenty of work that needs to be done. The people of Minnesota expect me to back up my beliefs with personal leadership and programs of substance.
That is exactly what I will continue to do.
The legislative proposals I present tonight are bold, but they are not surprising. They continue the familiar theme of jobs, jobs, and mure jobs.
Jobs through educational excellence, jobs through applied research and economic development, jobs through tax reform and jobs through a clean environment.
That is the blueprint. Here are the details.
I begin with education because education lays the foundation for everything we do in Minnesota. It consumes nearly one-half of our state budget. But every cent we invest in education produces dividends in our future economy. .

The same thing with mining - partnerships

saved jobs.



We joined with organized labor, Minnesota Power and Light and the taconite companies to make our taconite industry more competitive in world markets.

This year, everyone of our six plants will be at full production, producing 40,000,000 tons of taconite, our highest output in seven years.

Yet another success is our wood products and timber industry, where the private sector has invested over one billion dollars over the past five years and plans to invest $1,400,000,000 in the next five years.

I am proposing a series of reforms to improve what is already the lowest dropout rate in the nation. Our goal is "96 by 96," a 96 percent graduation rate by the year 1996.
To help our young children who have learning difficulties, I propose that local school districts be given the opportunity to invest in Early Childhood Education programs. We will also increase funding for our Head Start programs. Each dollar we invest in Early Childhood Education saves us nearly five dollars in spending later on.
I also propose that we offer Extended School Day programs in our schools from dawn until dusk. These programs will lower the dropout rate and help bridge the time gap between a normal school day and a normal work day.


In public hearings around the state, I have heard the anguish in the voices of working parents. I've heard this time and time again as they describe the choice between going on welfare and leaving their children alone because they cannot find affordable childcare.
The choice is even more tragic when the parent is in high school. Teenage pregnancy is one reason why one-half of the long-term users of Public Assistance in Minnesota are dropouts.
I am determined to break this cycle of poverty.
Beginning July 1st, school-aged welfare recipients must stay in school to be eligible for full benefits in Minnesota. For this plan to work responsibly, we need childcare for our high schools.
I have visited the childcare facilities in the Technical Institutes. For as long as I have been in public service, nothing has made me feel better than watching the students eat lunch with their child or children, return to class and then go home with their children at the end of the day.
Finally, I propose that state aid be extended to any adult who wants to come back and finish high school.
This package of reforms will deliver the message that it is never too early or never too late to learn in Minnesota. It will confirm that we do not drop people out of our school systems; we keep people in and bring people back so they can earn a diploma and a decent living for themselves and their families.
We will also challenge our students to set higher standards for themselves. So I propose a voluntary Governor's Scholarship Test at the 6th and 10th grade levels. Students who score at the top 25 percent on their test will receive a certificate as a Governor's Scholar. The top two achievers from each school district will be awarded a free quarter of college tuition when they graduate from high school.
I'm sure you can imagine with me the appetite for learning among 6th grade students who have already earned a stake in their post-secondary education!

..

To match that competitive enthusiasm with a sense of civic duty, I also propose naming Governor's Scholars for community service in each school district. By tutoring their classmates and promoting literacy in their neighborhoods, these students would receive the same tuition incentives as the academic scholars.
While visiting Marshall High School in Duluth last fall, I saw for myself the beauty of the best and the brightest students teaching their peers. A gleam of excitement and gratitude was in everybody's eyes. It was contagious. This kind of teamwork continues Minnesota's great heritage of action through partnerships.
It is the kind of teamwork we need if we are to compete effectively in the world economy. The information age-- has taken over the workplace. The jobs of the future rely more and more on applied research and the refinement of ideas.
It used to be that you learned a trade and that was your job security. But today, high-technology jobs are being restructured at least every seven years. Our workers require constant reeducation and training to keep pace with our changing technology.
To protect and prepare our working people, I propose a Minnesota Employment and Training Fund.
This fund would help retrain workers who have been laid-off from long-term employment due to plant closings and other severe shifts in the economy.
It would inspire more Minnesotans like Marilyn Wolfe of Bemidji to discover new skills. In the summer of 1982, Marilyn was a 39-year old single parent of two who had been laid off from her job at U.S. Steel's Minntac Plant at Mountain Iron, Minnesota. She made the courageous decision to go back to school.
Marilyn sold her possessions ana took a series of part-time jobs in order to attend the Technical Institute of Eveleth. After transferring to Bemidji State, she got straight A'son' her first report card. She decided she wanted to maintain that record for four years, and believe it or not she did - a straight 4.0 - all A's!


Last summer Marilyn went to Harvard.
This year she is attending the Yale University School of Organization and Management.
Who knows what this remarkable woman will do next?
I'd like to present to you Marilyn Wolfe!
There is much more that could be said. Her son went back as a mechanical engineer. Her son-in-law, who also had lost his job, will be an electrical engineer. So, from a blue collar family she's creating a family of people all going to college with college degrees. Isn't that wonderful?
I appointed Marilyn to the Minnesota State Board of Vocational Technical Education in 1983. During her two years on the board she constantly worked at finding ways to help nontraditional students to cope with the problems of getting an education.
The Employment and Training Fund is a response to her advocacy and a tribute to her determined spirit, a spirit that should be encouraged in every Minnesotan.
Retraining our workers is one piece of the partnership we need to succeed in the world economy. The other pieces are a first-rate postsecondary educational system and a program for applied research and development. -
We have begun the Commitment to Focus at the University of Minnesota, an important investment in our economic future. As we streamline the University's focus, we must establish our community colleges, our state universities, and our technical institutes as magnets for regional high-technology business growth.
That is why- I have come to Winona this evening. This campus, this city and this region are a perfect example of how partnerships between business and education can stimulate economic development.
Under the outstanding leadership of President Tom Stark, Winona State is an active- participant in a county where the unemployment rate is under five percent.

Thousands of people in this city are designing, manufacturing and selling the high-technology products that shape our future.
The Watlow Company is a world leader in the design of environmental test chambers.
The Fiberite Company makes heat shields for NASA rockets that endure temperatures up to 6,000 degrees.
Both companies are expanding in Winona creating more high-paying jobs to anchor the community.
Winona State's new engineering program is scientifically designed to provide these companies wIth skilled workers from among the local residents. These community partnerships form the essence of our blueprint for job creation.
We can see it in the training provided by the Winona Technical Institute. We can see it in the proposed expansion of the Rochester Center just west of here , where high-tech companies like the Mayo Clinic and IBM will invest in the education of local students to create quality jobs in that community.
At the government level, we must back up our support for these partnerships with' bricks and mortar. Higher student enrollments are bulging the seams of our campus facilities at Mankato Winona, St. Cloud and many other campuses: We must expand to meet the demand. We must develop creative programs like the proposed Agricultural Research Institute and the International Language Villages at Concordia College, Which help us to think globally and act locally.
We must accommodate and channel the brainpower that is crackling in every corner"and community of Minnesota.
Our public-private partnerships are joined toget?er by the Greater Minnesota Corporation, whIch paves a path for innovation from the classroom to the marketplace.
The GMC is the most strategic long-term job growth effort ever launched in Minnesota. It is a public corporation that operates like a business.


To protect itself from politics and swings in the economy, the GMC has invested its seed money. It will operate only on the interest and profits from that investment.
Let me give you just one example of how an applied research program like the Greater Minnesota Corporation can help create jobs in Minnesota.
University researchers in England and an agricultural lab in Illinois have come up with a way to produce biodegradable plastic bags using cornstarch. Consider the possible benefits from this single product.
A new market for millions of bushels of corn from Minnesota farmers.
New jobs for people who produce, market and distribute the bags.
Most important, a product that is compatible with Minnesota's tradition of environmental preservation.
The GMC will speed up the process that turns ideas into jobs.
No wonder former Governor Elmer Anderson has said:
"In launching the Greater Minnesota Corporation, we may have an agency that will be hailed fifty or one hundred years from noW as having generated a new level of prosperity and growth for our state.
"The Greater Minnesota Corporation comes at a strategic moment in the state's history, and can make an enormous contribution in the future."
Governor Anderson is right. To develop the products of tomorrow we need the Greater Minnesota Corporation.
There has been talk of raiding the GMC treasury to finance short-term programs in need of funding. This would be like burning our clothes to stay warm, or, as Senate Majority Leader Roger Moe has said, "It's like eating our seed corn." It's short-term thinking that

would shortchange our efforts to revitalize Greater Minnesota.
Another element of our blueprint for job creation is tax reform.
I have pledged to you that we will have a tax system that is competitive, fair, simple and job-creating, and I have held myself to that pledge despite the pressure of special interest groups.
Let me be specific.
Our competitive tax system cut personal income taxes by 26 percent. We dropped our income tax rate from 4th highest in the nation to 16th.
We cut the corporate tax rate from 12 to 9.5 percent, droppin~ the rate from the highest in the nation to 9th.
We cut our inheritance taxes down to the lowest in the nation.
And just last week, the Minnesota Taxpayers Association lowered Minnesota from 6th to 12th in total state and local tax collections per capita, the lowest ranking we've had in 17 years.
Last year, our Fair Tax System closed loopholes and special tax preferences. We required 8,000 corporate taxpayers to begin paying corporate taxes. We dropped 125,000 low-income Minnesotans from the tax rolls.
As a result, three out of four Minnesotans will be paying the same tax or less tax in 1988 than they were in 1986.
We simplified the tax system which allows two-thirds of Minnesota's taxpayers to fill out a tax form that has been reduced from 46 lines to nine lines.
That's right, from 46 lines to nine lines.
On the other side of the coin, we have increased the efficiency of our government services. We deliver quality services in state government while ranking 47th in the number of state employees on a per capita basis.

Our award-winning STEP program has come up with more than fifty ways to save money and improve services.
STEP is currently the subject of a case study at Harvard. It has quietly made a big impact on our state government and I am very, very proud of the people that are involved.
We will continue to improve government efficiency and reform our tax system.
This year I am proposing a major reform in our property taxes. We will reduce the number of property tax classifications from 68 to 4 and cut our Commercial/Industrial property tax rate by ten percent.
This continues our effort to produce a tax system that is competitive, fair, and simple; a tax system that helps create jobs in Minnesota.
I am confident about our economy, and our ability to create jobs. But the stock market crash on Wall Street and the huge deficits in Washington show us that we must be careful with our money. This means keeping our budget reserve at its current level of $345,000,000.
Last but certainly not least, our blueprint for job creation requires respect for our environment. We are a state of clean air, sparkling blue water, golden prairies and vast green forests. The beauty of our physical environment is Minnesota's blessing. The preservation and maintenance of that beauty is Minnesota's duty and a noble part of its heritage.
We had the nation's first - and strongest acid rain standards. More recently, our Reinvest in Minnesota program helped farmers transform acres of fragile and marginal lands into habitat for our fish and wildlife. But we must continue to be vigilant and take steps to protect our resources before they become endangered.
It is in that spirit that I propose a Comprehensive Waste Reduction and Recycling Act. This Act will help us regulate what goes into our landfills and prevent the contamination of our precious groundwater.

For every 100 bottles and cans we use, We recycle only three of them. The 12.5 million cubic yards of solid waste that we generate each year could fill up the Metrodome a hundred times, or about twice a week. You can see why our landfills are overloaded and why we need to do something about it.

The Recycling Act would coordinate our local recycling programs and give them enough money to be effective.

This money would come from a small deposit on beverage containers and a fee on non-degradable plastics that can't be recycled. Every Minnesotan should have the opportunity to recycle and to protect our groundwater. Passing this Recycling Act will give us that opportunity.

The final proposal I will make tonight will correct a basic flaw in our Environmental Protection Plan - the lack of a long-term funding source. Piecemeal funding for our environment is not enough. The truth is, adjusting for inflation, the money we spend to protect our natural resources has not grown over the past twelve years.

This is why I propose a Minnesota Environment and Natural Resources Trust Fund. This trust fund will provide the stable, long-term source of money needed for the care of our land, our air and our water.

The great Minnesota Naturalist Sigurd Olson has said:

"Our most important goal is preservation of

the land which is our home. To survive, we must

be eternally vigilant and embrace the broad concept of an environmental ethic."


The Minnesota Environment and Natural Resource Trust Fund would establish that environmental ethic so necessary to the survival of our children and grandchildren.

To fund this long-term initiative, I propose that the Legislature put the question of a state lottery on the ballot for the people to decide. And if the people approve the lottery, I propose that half of the proceeds be earmarked for the Environmental Trust Fund, and that the other

half go for the Greater Minnesota Corporation. This would provide us with tremendous environmental and job-creating benefits for decades to come.
A common thread has run through the proposals I have made this evening. They each represent durable policy, and focus on creating jobs both now and in the future.
From our "96 by 96" reforms and our bonding bill for education to our Employment and Training Fund....
To the Greater Minnesota Corporation To comprehensive tax reform ... Up to our Environmental Trust Fund The components of our blueprint for job creation prepare us for a secure and prosperous life - both now and in the 21 st century. We have worked long and hard to get to this point. We have carved out a program for educational excellence that has become a national model. We have established a public corporation for economic development that has the savvy, the flexibility and the clout to create jobs in Minnesota. We have totally overhauled our tax system. We have used the resources of our environment with a healthy respect for the consequences. Now we are poised and determined to follow through on our blueprint for job creation. I look forward to working with the Legislature to enact this blueprint, forming the legislative partnership that expresses the will of our people. I will tell you quite simply that I love the land and the people of Minnesota with all my heart. I am proud of the heritage that is Minnesota. And I will do everything in my power to uphold that heritage. Thank you and good night.Mr. Speaker, Mr. President, Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court, Constitutional Officers, members of the Legislature, former Governors - I want to take this opportunity for a little nostalgia. Fifty years ago, 26-year-old C. Elmer Anderson and 32-year-old Harold Stassen became Lieutenant Governor and Governor of Minnesota - 50 years ago today. I ask them both to stand at this time.
My fellow Minnesotans - in 1983, Minnesota's unemployment rate was over 10 percent.
We had lost our triple-A credit rating.
Our budget was on the brink of bankruptcy.
And we had no rainy-day fund.
Today - in 1989 - the State of our State is much stronger.·
Our unemployment rate is at four-and-a-half percent.
Over the past six years - we have created more than 340,000 jobs in Minnesota.
Our credit rating has been upgraded, and deficit spending has been replaced by sound fiscal management.
We have a rainy-day fund for financial emergencies that now totals 550 million dollars.
Together, we have been through bad times and good.
Consistently, from the bad times of 1983 to the good times of 1989 - the central goal of this administration has been the same -
Job Creation.
From the bad times of 1983 to the good times of 1989, we have focused on job creation through partnerships in four. key areas - 
Jobs through education ...
Jobs through research and development ...
Jobs through a clean environment ...

And jobs through tax reform and sound fiscal management.
Tonight, I ask once again that we continue this tradition of job creation.
First - by building the world's best education system.
Second - by fostering research and development.
Third - by maintaining the finest quality of life through a clean environment.
And fourth - by improving the business climate through tax reform.
We begin with education because our jobs and the jobs of our children will depend upon the quality of our educational system.
Just as our parents lifted themselves up by their bootstraps, our children will move themselves forward on the strength of their brainpower.
Four years ago today - on January 4th, 1985 - we launched an education plan known as "Access to Excellence" -
A plan that the Christian Science Monitor has since called - "The most intensive, substantial effort at education reform in United States history."
Under Access To Excellence, we are the first state to establish the right of students to choose the schools and the programs best suited to their needs.
Under Access To Excellence, we were the first state in the union to allow high school students to take classes at colleges and universities at state expense.
Under Access To Excellence, we have provided a variety of education options for students who have dropped out or who are at risk of dropping out of school.
And under Access To Excellence - we enable students to choose an elementary or secondary school on the basis of quality and compatibility with their needs.
Choice works.
If you have any doubts, consider Stacy Condon of Minneapolis.

Earlier this year, Stacy's mother wrote to tell me what a difference Access To Excellence had made in the Condon family.
Two years ago, Stacy was ranked in the lower third of her high school class, and planned to quit school at the age of 16.
But after enrolling in our post-secondary enrollment options program, Stacy discovered the joy and the power of learning.
Last June, she simultaneously graduated from high school and completed her first year of college with a full 45 credits and a highB average.
"Stacy had the ability to succeed," her mother wrote, but "without an alternative educational program, I'm convinced she would not have graduated."
Stacy's mother ended her letter' with these words: "There is ao doubt in my mind that the money spent to support Stacy through this program will be repaid many times over in the form of taxes generated through higher earnings and the personal contributions she will make as an educated member of our society."
At this time I would like to introduce Stacy Condon and her mother, Marilyn. Would you please stand. We are very proud of you, Stacy.
Stacy's story will be repeated time and time again throughout Minnesota if we provide the information necessary for our students to make informed choices.
Four years ago, I said that our educational system should be strengthened through competition and accountability.
Last month, the legislative auditor issued a report on our educational system,_ that affirmed the need for greater accountability.
Tonight - as I did in 1985 - I am calling for statewide testing.
Testing will be conducted in the core curriculum areas of math, science, English and social studies at both the 6th and 10th grade level.
The state will publish the results on a district-by-district basis.

Testing will provide information that helps parents and students choose which schools best fit the students' needs.


Choice, supported by testing, will create a marketplace for education that is accountable and responsive to the individual needs of our students.
Competition in education through school choice is the way to build the world's best educational system, and continue our tradition of job creation.



Research and development is the second consistent component of our job creation strategy.
Over the past six years, private industry research has focused more on short-term investments. At the same time, the federal government has concentrated its research in highly classified areas of defense.
We have accepted the challenge of filling in the research gap, to create another generation of 3Ms, Blandins and Crays for the 21 st century.

In 1983, we began building engineering schools in St. Cloud, Mankato and Duluth, and a Natural Resources Research Institute at UMD.

Since then we've added another engineering school in Winona, a Supercomputer Institute at the University of Minnesota, and two months ago began work on four Agriculture Research and Utilization Institutes.

These agricultural institutes will develop technologies that create new uses for our crops and expand markets for our farmers.

Last year, I showed you a biodegradable plastic bag made from cornstarch, using a technology that researchers say could use up to 500 million bushels of corn a year.

Another agricultural product with great potential is a printing ink made from soybeans.

This newspaper - Agri-News - is just one of the many publications in Minnesota and across the country that are being printed with a soybean-based ink.

As with biodegradable bags, this product is opening new markets and increasing demand for crops grown by our farmers.

We have established the Greater Minnesota Corporation as the centerpiece of our research and development effort.
The GMC is up and running - and already is earning respect.
The Chicago Tribune has called it the most far-reaching state plan for research and technology in the country.
And here in Minnesota, the St. Paul Pioneer Press-Dispatch has written that the GMC is on a course that "should bring economic development projects to both rural "and urban areas of the state," and "would expand Minnesota's role as one of the nation's leading science and technology states."
The fact is that research and development represents the most dynamic force' for job creation in the global economy.
President Reagan has said that technology will lead to a new industrial revolution.

Soviet President Gorbachev has called technology the key to transforming his nation's economy.
The Japanese are counting on technology to make them the economic superpower of the 21st century.
The competition is fierce - but our
commitment is strong and our vision is clear.
Whether it is research and development for
agriculture or biotechnology, for supercomputers or natural resources, Minnesota will
take a back. seat to no one when it comes
to turning the ideas of the classroom into products for the global marketplace.
Our commitment to research and development will make Minnesota one of the nation's
leading science and technology states.


The third consistent component in our job creation strategy is firmly embedded in Minnesota's great heritage - the protection and preservation of our environment.

In 1983, the Conservation Foundation conducted a survey to see which states Ñ if any - could simultaneously develop their economy and protect their environment.
When the group issued its report, Minnesota was ranked number one for protecting our environment while developing the economy.
Since then, we have lived up to our position of national leadership in this field.
In 1983, we created a state Superfund to clean up toxic waste.
In 1986, we passed the Re-Invest In Minnesota program to protect thousands of acres of land as wildlife habitat.
Finally, in November of 1988, the people of Minnesota overwhelmingly endorsed the creation of an Environment and Natural Resources Trust Fund, the first of its kind in the nation.
These are just a few of the reasons why the Nature Conservancy has said - "When looking for leadership in natural areas protection, we and other conservation organizations throughout the nation have always looked with respect and admiration to Minnesota."
As the nation looks to Minnesota in 1989, our environmental leadership will continue.
The drought of last year taught us that our water resources are fragile and require constant care to ensure their proper use.
In the coming weeks - I will outline a program for water protection.
And I will talk about our vision for an Environmental Compact of the States.
We know that many of the challenges to our environment extend beyond the borders of a single state.
These challenges require national cooperation and national leadership.
As the chair of the Education Commission of the States, I have seen bow effectively states can work together through a national partnership to address common concerns in education.

I believe an Environmental Compact of the States - headquartered right here in Minnesota - can bring Americans together in a similar fashion to address common concerns about the environment.
As an official from the Natural Resources Defense Council has said - "There have always been some states like Minnesota that have been out in the forefront and didn't need the federal government to tell them what to work on."
An Environmental Compact of the States will once again prove the truth of that statement, and will help safeguard the clean environment that is critical to our tradition of job creation.
The fourth and final consistent component of our job creation strategy is tax reform through sound fiscal management.
Back in the difficult days of 1983, when there were many demands on our revenues, I offered the challenge that we tighten our belts and establish a budget reserve - a rainy day fund to protect us from shifts in the economy.
Today, while the federal government faces a mountain of debt, and states from California to Massachusetts and from New York to Arizona wrestle with cutting services or raising taxes to balance their budgets, we have kept our rainy-day fund secure.
This policy of sound fiscal management will continue.
Failure by the federal government to solve the federal budget deficit and to correct the trade imbalances could have severe adverse effects on the Minnesota economy, as well as the rest of the nation.
Even as we experience an economic boom in many parts of the state, and even as there are funding requests for many worthy programs, I will call again for budget restraint to protect us against the effects of any possible downturns in the economy.
We tightened our belts in the difficult days of 1983. We know we can hold the line on spending in 1989.


In previous speeches - I have said that our first and foremost objective is to make Minnesota competitive with the rest of the country.
Since that time, we have lowered our corporate tax from 12 to 9.5 percent.
We cut our individual income tax rate in half.
We reduced our inheritance taxes from among the highest in the nation to among the lowest in the nation.
And our unemployment compensation rates are now 21 st in the nation.
We are proud of these successes.
In 1989 - our work on tax reform will continue.
Property taxes remain a major problem for many Minnesotans.
I am committed to reducing property taxes where the burdens are the highest - for middle-value homesteads, apartments, rental homes, and for businesses.
We must also reform the way the state finances local government operations.
Sixty-five percent of all state tax dollars are sent back to schools and local governments.
I will be proposing ways to improve the fairness and efficiency of this property tax system.
Property tax reform will further improve our business climate - which has turned around in the past six years.
In 1983, everyone talked about a job drain from Minnesota to North Dakota and South Dakota.
But in 1989, the man who was Governor of North Dakota six years ago - Allen Olson - goes to work at his job in Minnesota.
And in 1989, the man who was Governor of South Dakota six years ago - Bill Janklow - also works in Minnesota.
The fact is that there are more than seven business start-ups or expansions in Minnesota every single day of the year.

That is a net start-up and expansion figure that takes into account the businesses you read about that leave this state.
Furthermore, the failure rate of Minnesota businesses is 45 percent lower than the national average.
The bottom line is that not only do we create jobs in Minnesota - we preserve and enhance the jobs that we have created.
In every region of the state last year, businesses responded to the brainpower and productivity of Minnesota's workers.
The Swift Meat Company expanded its operations in Worthington, calling it the crown jewel of its national operation.
IBM chose its employees in Rochester to design and manufacture its newest line of computers.
The Deluxe Check Corporation created 1,500 manufacturing jobs through its expansion in Shoreview.
And in the largest private sector industrial expansion in Minnesota history, Boise Cascade is investing one-half billion dollars into its paper mill in International Falls.
These expansions by our top corporate citizens create tens of thousands of jobs and deserve to make headlines.
They represent the essence of the Minnesota spirit, and the essence of our tradition of job creation.
Since 1983, you have heard me say that my top three goals as Governor are jobs, jobs and more jobs for the people of this state.
I would like to close this evening by sharing my thoughts on what a job means to me..
A person with a job knows that he or she can do something well enough to be paid for it, and that knowledge provides dignity and hope.
A job gives a person the power to dream, and the strength to work toward the fulfillment of that dream.

I have seen the way people who do not have a job are treated.
I have seen the struggle and the quiet desperation that many of them endure.
Many of you have heard me talk about growing up on the Iron Range where my father was an iron ore miner.
When he had a job, our family was happy.
But I learned at a very young age that when my father's lunch bucket was on the shelf, there would be no job for him that day and less income for the family.
The longer that lunch bucket stayed on the shelf, the less my father would speak, and the more I would see tears on my mother's face.
Through those hard times, my parents held the family together with love and hard work - and taught my brothers and me the meaning of a job.
Tonight I would like to publicly introduce my mother and father, Mary and Anton Perpich - the first time they have attended one of my State of the State speeches.
And I would like to thank them for the examples that they set for me, and the lessons that they gave to me, on the value of never giving up, or giving in to despair.
I thought of my parents and my childhood often during the early part of this decade when Minnesota was hit with a double depression in our mining and farm economies.
We all read in the papers of the number of jobs lost, and we saw mining towns like Babbitt and Silver Bay devastated - and Main Street businesses in farm towns like' Benson and Appleton and Slayton closing their doors.
Back in those difficult days, I knew that behind each number in the jobs-lost column was a family struggling to survive.
And behind the doors in the homes of those mining and farm families, there were people suffering in silence and tears.
It was during that time that I decided that jobs would be the central and overriding goal of this administration.
10

And it was during that time that I developed a job creation strategy, based on the belief that every single one of us deserves the chance to make a better life through a job that pays a decent wage.
In every State of the State message since 1983, this strategy for job creation has remained consistent.
Tonight I renew my pledge to the people of Minnesota, that as long as I am Governor - in boom times and recession, in good times and bad - I will remain consistent in my efforts to create jobs.
Jobs through education . Jobs through research . Jobs through a clean environment ... And jobs through tax reform. Together, we will carry our tradition of job creation forward... Today, tomorrow, and into the future ... where our hopes, dreams and accomplishments await us. Thank you and good night.Mr. Speaker, mr. President, mr. Chief justice, members of the court, constitutional officers, members of the legislature, former governors, people of Minnesota. Eleven weeks ago i asked Minnesotans to tell me how drugs affected their lives.
And here is what they said.

Drugs destroy lives. Drugs have no place in Minnesota. No place in our schools no place in our neighborhoods. No place in our families. Drugs have overwhelmed other states but not Minnesota. Minnesota leads the nation because Minnesota met the drug problem head-on. Over half a century beginning at willmar state hospital and then at hazelden Minnesota developed a program for treating addiction. Known as the Minnesota model the program saves lives all over the world. Most states would be satisfied having given the world a treatment program but Minnesota has done more. Minnesota always does more. In Minnesota we build on our success. Since 1983 we have more than doubled funding for alcohol and drug prevention programs in our schools. In 1983 we created the criminal justice task force. In 1985 we created the chemical dependency treatment fund. Minnesota was the first state to provide drug treatment on demand. In 1986 Minnesota's plan for using federal anti-drug money was recognized as a model for the nation. In 1987 we created the high school graduation incentives program which gives students with drug problems a chance to start over.

In 1989 ... Based in part ... On the work of the criminal justice task force we passed tougher criminal penalties for people who possess or sell drugs.
In 1989 ... We also enacted the "year of the city." we are rebuilding neighborhoods ... Training the unemployed ... And providing mental health care and child care.
Drugs will not disappear unless our communities are healthy. Our drug policy is comprehensive ... We treat both the individual and the community.
We in Minnesota government always do more than expected ... Because the people of Minnesota always do more than expected.
During the last six weeks ... I have met with people dedicated to chasing drugs and crime from their neighborhoods.
In minneapolis.. I visited with members of the whittier neighborhood who are forcing landlords to evict tenants who run crack houses.

In st. Paul ... I met with nick davis ... One of the heroes of the drug war. Nick and his neighbors are chasing drug dealers out of their neighborhood. Minnesotans know that apathy is the drug dealer's greatest ally. Minnesotans are willing to organize their communities against drugs ... But they need guidance and they need funding. The state will supply both. As governor ... I am determined to multiply neighborhood drug programs. With every Minnesota neighborhood organized against drugs ... We will have a strike force four million people strong. Four million people fighting the spread of drugs. Four million people helping those addicted to drugs. Minnesota ... I am proud to say ... Provides treatment on demand. Most areas of the country have long waiting lists. With drugs ... Delay means death. Waiting lists in Minnesota will never be acceptable. We must increase funding for our chemical dependency treatment fund. We must also continue to develop specialized treatment programs.

Last week i visited the four winds program in brainerd ... A treatment program developed specifically for native americans. The program combines native american history and culture with a modern treatment program.
The four winds program works. Specialized treatment programs work.
I am also asking for resources to develop aftercare programs. We must help people as they adjust to drug-free lives.
Drug-free lives for all Minnesotans ... That is my goal. A goal we will not reach until we decide that drug use is unacceptable. As unacceptable as slavery ... As unacceptable as torture.
Drug addiction is a form of slavery ... It is a form of torture.
Until Minnesotans harden their minds against drug use ... We will need a strong criminal justice system to shield us from the violence of drugs.
To improve law enforcement ... I recommend we hire more agents for the bureau of criminal apprehension ... Expand training of local police ... And provide funds to local law enforcement task forces.
And to help courts respond quickly i recommend 12 new judges.

In addition ... I ask the legislature to expand sentencing alternatives and supervised probation so nonviolent criminals can be dealt with more effectively. I also ask the legislature to expand the drug treatment programs in prisons. No one should ever leave prison with a craving for drugs. The theme of my speech is "building on success." in the fight against drugs ... Minnesota schools are our greatest success. Those who despair about the drug crisis should look here at jefferson high school.. And down the street at olson junior high. Both schools have nationally recognized drug prevention programs. Currently every school in the state is required by law to have a drug prevention program. I am determined that every school in Minnesota will have a drug program as good as the one here at jefferson. Let's give jefferson high school a big hand for doing such a great job. We have already more than doubled funding for school drug programs. I will ask the legislature to fund more career teachers and non-profit providers so students receive individualized attention.

And finally.. I will be proposing an increase in funding to schools so that the dare program and project charlie are available to more schools. Project charlie was created in edina 13 years ago. On a visit to woodland elementary in eagan ... I was impressed by the way project charlie got the message about drugs to children. We must bring the dare program and project charlie to more schools in Minnesota. And to reach children early ... We must involve parents. The early childhood family education program ... Strengthens families by teaching parents to help their children. Children with supportive parents are better prepared for school and have greater self-confidence. We must expand this program up to the third grade. I am also seeking an increase in funding for head start so we can serve more children ... Especially homeless children . . Head start graduates do better in school ... They do better at home ..And they do better in life. Yet only 30 percent of eligible children participate in the program.

No matter how good our teachers are ... And our teachers are the best ... There is one group of children no school alone can help. The children of addicts.
Children born addicted to drugs. Children beaten, abused and neglected.
I will propose legislation to help these children. But we can't legislate a perfect world. I need your help. We must unite to protect the children. We must unite to protect ourselves. And we must unite four million strong. To drive drugs from Minnesota.
I have asked students from bloomington to join me in a . Pledge against drugs. The pledge is in your program.
So will you please stand and join us ... A small segment of Minnesota ... As we recite this pledge:

I pledge never to use drugs to help those addicted to drugs and to fight the spread of drugs until we are the first state in the nation drug free.
I want to thank each and every one of you for pledging your support to make Minnesota drug free. Thank you very much.Mr. speaker, Mr. President, Mr. Chief Justice, members of the Court, Constitutional Officers, members of the Legislature and my fellow Minnesotans:
Opening statement: War in the Middle East; deaths of Karl Rolvaag and Gus Donhowe

Richly blessed with rivers, lakes, streams, major cultural center - agriculture and agribusiness.
Spawned 3M - gave birth to large scale computers at Control Data and Cray Research.
Our University became a major research center guiding the way to everything from taconite to human transplants.
Our people have won awards ranging from Nobel Prizes to Pulitizers to National Athletic Championships.

We are a healthy, productive people with our roots and

traditions deep in Minnesota soil.
Our pioneering stock is still with us, we are adventurers , bright, brawny and optimistic.


Now that quality of life is threatened. It is not just the recession or war, but rather driven by our sense of anxiety. We are uncertain about our future.
a. Real income has declined for the past three years. People are working hard and actually earning less. They see us slipping in everything from school test scores to political ethics to down grading of living standards.
b. Jobs have peen slowly disappearing along North Dakota and South Dakota- and now along Iowa. Wisconsin has now become a real job threat as they have emerged as a lower cost state.
c. Competition for jobs is a real fear. But the real anxiety goes beyond that point. Our values of prudence have peen assaulted. Assaulted by a culture that has focused on short-term greed. The "What's in it for me" philosophy has prevailed.
The 80's may we be remembered as the decade of greed. It permeated all institutions and all sectors of life 

Now one day after we honor Dr. Martin Luther King, we have an opportunity to put all that aside and do what King's life stood for an appeal to the best that lies within us all. We must challenge the past or become a prisoner of it. I say that people want a "new beginning" with a focus on excellence, truth and a summons to duty.

You and I sought the opportunity to serve. We told the people that we had the power and courage to change things Ñ now. Let us live up to that promise of change.
All too often, government holds itself out as an agent of change, but that is not always true. The fact is we tend to dislike change because it compels us to get out of our comfortable rut. The status quo is comfortable.
Politically we created a system where some 400 units of government come to st. Paul and plead for more money. There is very little discussion about goals or objectives or performance - primarily just the need for more money to continue the past.

a. For six years during the 80's we ranked third in total government spending growth 

b. Spending grew 35 percent higher, than personal income; 42 percent higher than the gross state product; 57 percent higher than inflation.

c. During this timeframe, had we spent at the rate of inflation, we would now have $9 billion.

Neal Peirce last week changed his tune about Minnesota. No longer were we the state that worked or the Dynamo of Reform, but another one that co~sted down "fiscal Easy street" during the 1980's.
We avoided the tough decisions.

We followed the lead of the federal government by spending money

that we did not have and pretending to the people that all was well.

"Trust us" was our motto. We, on the state level, authorized over

$900 million of new debt, a 22 percent increase since 1988.

Cities, townships and counties increased their debt 54 percent

since 1983 -- from $2.8 billion to a whopping $4.3 billion.

We favored soccer stadiums over child nutrition, community

centers and swimming pools over classrooms while we transferred record

levels of debt to our children. On the operating side of the budget,

we favored spending over discipline.


Since July of 1989, we on the state level have been spending

$800,000 per day more than we have been taking in. That comes to over

$24 million a month. And when leaders like Gene Merriam and Duane

Benson said "fix it," we ignored them and pretended all was well.

So we have a past that is rich with blessings and some

short-sighted behavior that embarrasses us. I say, challenge the

past. Let us go forth and see the challenges ahead as opportunities
and not as pits of hopelessness and anguish.

Let us do what we told our people we would do -- lead with

intelligence and courage.

Our first challenge is the current budget. We are now spending,

as I indicated, $800,000 per day more than we have taken in. If we

chose to ignore this hemorrhaging, we will have spent $600 million

more over the past two years than we took in.

In order to better plan our financial future, t asked a

bipartisan panel of financial experts to evaluate our current

financial situation and make some recommendations.

This Blue Ribbon Panel consisted of former finance commissioners
who served both Democrat and Republican Governors and experts from the
private sector. Their recommendation was unanimous - cut $197 million
from the current bUdget right now and then reduce anticipated spending
by $1.8 billion in the budget for the next two year period. I think
this is good advice.
It is tempting to go into the state's $550 million emergency
reserve fund. but that would be like dipping into a savings account in order to pay for a life style we cannot afford. It would simply be
another postponement of the problem. But let me also share with you certain facts:

1. We have this problem largely because we spent more than we earned. Raising taxes or depleting our savings is not the
answer.
2. The recession is saucer-shaped and recovery will be slow.

3. Any tampering with the reserve fund will attract the attention of the bond rating agencies and possibly place our bond ratings and those of local governments in jeopardy.

4. We have an additional $1.8 billion problem that we will deal with in February but suffice it to say, prudence says "protect the reserves." 

No, the only choice is to reduce our current expenditures.


Now I know that there will be cries of protest. We have built a system of government where spending is favored over prudent behavior. But, let us look at the facts:

1. Every state that surrounds us is more tax and job competitive.

2. The Great Lakes Governors met last week and not one indicated
a willingness to increase taxes. They all know the value of
jobs.

3. As Joanell and I traveled through Minnesota this summer and

fall, the message was clear - reduce government spending and

reduce taxes. The people are tightening their belts and they

want us to do the same.

Let us do it willingly and without complaint.

I am pleased with the speed with which the Legislature is processing the reduction bill. It shows that we can and will work together, always putting the long-term interests of people first.

Now let me briefly touch on another matter of great urgency workers compensation reform. Three times this Legislature courageously passed a reform measure and three times it was not signed into law. Rest assured that I will work with you to achieve passage.

Let us send out a bipartisan signal to all those who create
jobs. We want our costs of doing business in Minnesota to be competitive with other progressive states because we want jobs and we want more jobs for our people.
If we can just discipline our spending and make job creation costs competitive with other states, believe me, this will be a most successful legislative session.

But I think we can do more.

I. First of all, we can stop micro-managing our entire

governmental system. Federal - state - Local. It is too costly and

gets in the way of solution and lacks political integrity.

Local Government - day care -- education - environment

Our budgets are line-item. We must continue process toward performance based budgeting. Representative Simoneau and Senator erriam have led the way in these reforms. I commend the Legislature. Let us focus on outcome and value of our services.

Focus on Education - We may be short on dollars but not on reforms:

1. We will not run local schools from st. Paul. Site-based management will be our goal.
Local Government - Maximize flexibility and creativity. We are hamstringing our teachers. Let teachers do what they do best - teach

2. A new contract - children - parents - teachers - community state - accountability and results.
3. Train children for jobs that exist - build an understanding between schools and business so that a natural relationship occurs always with a focus on excellence. Our children must know that there is a linkage between high grades and good jobs.
4. Seventy-four percent of our teenagers are in the labor force. This is the highest in the United States. This is both good news/bad news situation.

a. Work ethic is strong,"
b. Students who work are often tired - they are lulled into false sense of security. They must know the value of a high school diploma. The primary role of the student is to
study and work hard. Jobs are secondary.

III. Long term property tax reform: 1. commercial-industrial property tax rates are the highest outside of New York City.

2. We must work toward eliminating the third tier of property taxes for homeowners. More progressive than the income tax and very punitive.

IV. New Partnerships

Now we have a host of concerns that compel government to think
differently. Over the past twenty years, government has been the

provider of first choice and not the provider of last resort.

Somehow we have decided that we have the capacity to solve all

problems. We have encouraged people to seek a government remedy

without first exploring other options. The result is we have gotten

ourselves into activities well. beyond government's role and ability.

We have subsidized homes for the ver,y wealthy, thrown enormous

subsidies at out of state businesses in the hopes of luring them into
Minnesota, and just recently disclosed a tax subsidy to a nightclub

promoting nude dancing.

Government must define itself and its mission. We must agree

that the states who know where they are going are the ones most likely

to take the right direction. After all, as w learned from Alice in
Wonderland, if you do not know where you are going, any road will get
you there. We know where we are going.

We are going to make Minnesota more job competitive with other states. Four years from now I hope we will read stories in Wisconsin

newspapers about how Minnesota is attracting jobs instead of vice

versa.

That means we have to hone in on government costs, put logic and

fairness in our regulatory system, and focus on our vision for the

future by protecting and enhancing our assets and overcoming our

liabilities. The first step will be the creation of a private-public
partnership that will help define:

a. Government relations so we can define the function of
government, where that function ought to be located, the value
of that function. In other words, specifically define goals and
objectives and accountability,

b. Review governmental costs and work with management on instituting the efficiencies necessary to provide the tax payer with a real quality service at an affordable price.
It is our intent in that this partnership, which we will call
the Committee on Reform and Governmental Efficiency -- CORAGE -- will work closely with the Dyrstad commission of local government so that all have input into the process. Rest assured, Minnesotans want cost-efficient government.

..Our concept of new partnerships ,

also extends to the one between

the Governor and Lt. Governor. I said at the outset that Joanell

Dyrstad will be a spokesperson for this administration and I meant it.

Minnesota has always been known as a state filled with people of

vision and creativity. If there ever was a moment in our state

history when a sense of vision was absolutely essential, it is now.

Our state has, as I have outlined, a serious short-term bUdget

problem, and we will deal with that. But over the next four years, we

will be looking beyond the present and into the future of this state.
We must become geared up to meet the long-range challenges of
interstate and global competition. We need to reestablish goals and

form long term objectives to reach those goals. We can begin by

forging new partnerships and creating new structures that will take

Minnesota into the 21st century.

We know we must change the way state and local governments

operate. The relationship between the federal government and state
and local governments has changed. Federal revenue sharing no longer
exists. Federal support to pay for major new, as well as ongoing
social initiatives, is no longer a reality. We recognize that and we

have and will adapt to it.

In 1932, Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis coined the phrase "laboratories of democracy." He was talking about state governments and the idea, as he put it, that "a single courageous state may, if its citizens choose, serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic experiments without risk to the rest of the county." 

A laboratory of democracy is what Minnesota must become over the next four years if we are to make the fundamental changes that are vital to the social welfare and economic health of our state.
One experiment we will be focusing on is the forming of new partnerships and an examination of existing ones. state support of local government activity is being reduced. It is a challenge local government can rise to if they are given the flexibility to do so. Local government has adapted well before and will do so again. The removal of unnecessary mandates and the improvement in tha working relationship between state agencies and local governments will be a big step in improving communication and strengthening that relationship.
Municipalities have positioned themselves well with $183 million in reserves; counties have $245 million in reserve. They are well aware of the impact of taxes on the creation of new jobs. Many Minnesota firms have moved across the border to Wisconsin and more are posturing themselves to do so because of taxes; and, Governor Thompson has pledged "no new taxes."
We need to realistically face that competition. To do that, then, we must design new management techniques, restructure bureaucracies, empower our employees and instill a new dedication to making state government and local government consumer-oriented and user-friendly.


It is our responsibility to listen to the taxpayers, not the tax-spenders. Our consumers will tell us what they need and are willing to pay for. As I have said, we are challenging the past. 
We need to create new partnerships with the people of our state

as well. We need to bring down the barriers to participation in the

economy, whether they be poverty, racial and/or sexual discrimination,

illiteracy, access to child care or government regulation.

We need to start early and focus on prevention. This means

supporting programs that reduce unwanted pregnancies, provide access

to pre-natal care, and teach parents how to do a good job of raising

their children.

We will be focusing on day care. We are not going to be using building codes to keep churches and synagogues out of the day care
business any more. If government cannot solve the problem, the least

we can do is to help those who can.

And our administration would rather spend $2,600 to enroll a

child in Head Start for a year than pay $30,000 a year down the line

to house that person in a state prison.

We need to forge new partnerships between education and social
service organizations. Many of our children just are not ready to
learn when they come to school.

Some are not ready because they live in homes where domestic

violence so scars them that they lose the capacity to relate to other

people.

We have good laws to protect battered families, but we need to

improve enforcement. A "cooling off" period may help when someone in the family has been arrested for domestic abuse or for violation of an order for protection.


Had such a policy been in place for Kathryn Hebert (A-BER), we
perhaps would not have had to face the horror of finding her body in a
shallow grave, and her children would still have a mother.

Children who are not ready to learn, for whatever reason, will

not learn, no matter how talented and dedicated are their teachers.

Schools need to be able to concentrate their efforts on teaching

children. The entire community, each and every one of us, must assume

responsibility for each and every child in our state.

Luckily, we will not have to do it all ourselves. This is one
of the great things about the people of Minnesota: People want to help. They want to pitch in. They want the barriers removed.

We are fortunate to live in a state where volunteering is an

integral part of our culture and heritage. Fifty-eight percent of

Minnesota adults give an average of four hours each week to help

others. The Minnesota Office of Volunteer Services calculates that

Minnesotans contribute about $4.2 billion dollars worth of services

every year.

Minnesotans are extremely creative in developing working

volunteer partnerships. Churches, businesses, schools and clubs are

reaching out. We are asking you to join us by saying -- "yes, I can

do that"

I can pitch garbage in a can so someone else does not have to pick it up. I can recycle to save the environment. I can volunteer to help paint someone's house, or deliver a meal, or assist in my child's school. I can lend that helping hand.

You and I must become participants in our society, relying less on government to solve every problem and more on ourselves.


By involving our people and our communities and our institutions

in new partnerships, we can create a new model for state government --

one that can provide leadership and vision not only here in Minnesota,

but elsewhere in the country.

We will also create new partnerships with business. We need to

create an entrepreneurial climate in this state, where public and

private sector leaders -- aided, not hindered, by state government

can come together and pursue new ventures, start new companies, and

create new jobs for Minnesotans.


We are excited about forming partnerships with young businesses

which will grow and expand and become our Fortune 500 companies of

tomorrow.

Minnesota is well known for the ones we have now -- 3M,

Northwest Airlines, General Mills, and so many others -- and we must

keep them strong. But the state's future is being creative right now

with new start-ups -- companies that export products and import jobs.

I have asked some of these people to join us, to give you

examples of this spirit. There are many more. These are people who

have taken small companies and expanded them through personal

initiative and commitment to Minnesota.

Glen Taylor, head of Taylor Corporation of North Mankato, which now employs 3,000 people in the Mankato area; and
Greg Herrick, head of Zeos International of New Brighton, a manufacturer of personal computers; T. Michael Clarke, CEO of KATUN Corporation of Bloomington, a leading supplier of copier and printer parts;
Ron Eibensteiner, president of Mirror Technologies of Roseville,
a manufacturer of peripheral equipment for computers;
Kay Fredericks, president of Trend Enterprises, which designs
and manufactures educational products.

Will you people stand up and be recognized. These people

represent the future of our state, and there are many more like them.

What will it take for businesses like these to succeed, and for

more just like them to grow?

Before we do anything, we must get the fiscal crisis behind us, by reforming workers comp and the commercial-industrial property tax system.

Beyond that, we need to create a competitive environment, an

environment that is at least competitive with states with whom we

share a border.

Last fall the people of Minnesota chose us to be their agents of

change. We intend to fulfill that legacy. Now I would like to touch

on a few of our priorities.


within state government, we intend,to create a climate where

there is equal opportunity for all Minnesotans. We have asked Linda

Barton, Commissioner of Employee Relations, to begin immediately to

develop a training program for all state employees to increase

awareness and sensitivity to human rights issues. Let no one think

for one moment that enduring sexual harassment falls within the scope

of their employment. It does not.

When it comes to the environment, we need to start with the

notion that we are stewards of our land. Our children deserve to inherit a state which reflects care and respect for the environment.


Our priority this session will be to work for passage of the no-net-loss wetlands bill. This is not a new proposal, but it is one
that has never reached the Governor's desk to be signed into law.

We stand herb tonight to tell you that we support the

no-net-loss wetlands bill and ask you to work together on a

bi-partisan basis to pass it.

Representative Willard Munger, you are the dean of this body and

we are asking you to join hands with Marcus Marsh and get this bill to

my desk as soon as possible.

Also, I want to hold those who pollute our environment
accountable for the cleanup. There is also a fairness issue here.

Environmental violations must be dealt with fairly and with uniform

penalties against all violators, and we will work toward that end.

In the next four years, we believe there is much to be gained

from reorganizing both the Pollution Control Agency and the Department

of Natural Resources. We would like to see more resources directed to

field work throughout the state and less to "paper shufflers" here in

St. Paul.

The 1990 Legislature passed a landmark law called the toxic

pollution prevention act. It was designed to encourage businesses and

individuals to reduce the amount of dangerous chemicals released into

the air, water and ground.

Representative Munger, I pledge that our administration will

vigorously enforce your law. Whenever we deal with natural resources, we must remember that we do not inherit these resources from our parents but rather we borrow them from our children. Our children are well ahead of us on

this issue.

We intend to forge new partnerships in protecting out

environment. In doing so, we must strike a delicate balance and see:

mutual harmony among the tourism industry, sportsmen- and -women,

business, and those who wish to preserve the serenity of a clear river

or a majestic forest.

Another priority of ours is affordable health care for every

Minnesotan. We recognize that this is an ambitious undertaking, and

we will not be able to turn our full attention to it until our bUdget

crisis is solved. But we will be proposing a pilot project in the budget we submit

for the next two years that will begin to address this important

matter.

However, we in government are not 100 percent of the answer to

this problem either. If everyone in Minnesota would make the

commitment to stop smoking, to exercise regularly and to eat more

healthy foods we could make enormous reductions in the cost of health

care.

We as individuals must begin to recognize that we have an

obligation.

Once the budget situation is under control, we would also like

to find a way to make higher education affordable to our citizens in

an era of spiralling college costs. Higher education should not be

out of the reach of so many people, and the Edvest program I proposed

earlier is one way to make college more affordable.
For two marvelous weeks in January, the eye of the world focused on Minnesota. They saw our Metrodome, our ice palace, and felt the warmth and glow of our people.
We showed the world the special "can do" attitude of Minnesotans. Who else would celebrate winter by engaging in outdoor competitions of every kind, castle building, sculpture making, softball on ice, cross-country skiing, skating and snowmobiling.
That "can do" attitude was not born in 1992. It was forged in our earliest days when the first pioneers began to settle here. They built farms, mined ore, logged and fished. Minnesota was the rugged frontier that attracted those who understood the risk in opportunity and the hard work in success.
In 1847 a 30 year-old teacher and missionary named Harriet Bishop traveled alone from Vermont to create the first public school in St Paul. She traveled by lake, land and river through the wilderness, and made the last leg of the trip up the Mississippi by canoe with two Dakota Indian women.
At that time, St. Paul was no more than a cluster of log huts along the Mississippi. Harriet Bishop's first school house was a former blacksmith shop in downtown Saint Paul. Rats and snakes plagued her mud plastered log schoolhouse and she had only a few school books.
She also started Minnesota's first Sunday school class. By the third Sunday she had attracted 25 children with such diverse backgrounds that an interpreter was needed who spoke English, Dakota and French.

At times Miss Bishop became discouraged with her new life on the frontier. She wondered whether her words were having the smallest effect on these young minds. Yet she persevered.
And her students, and the students of other pioneer teachers ultimately built the Minnesota we know today.
· They founded our first mills, our first companies and developed our farms
· They created our education system, our parks system and our transportation system.
· They built our network of working, successful communities.
The quality of life we enjoy today is the legacy of their efforts. And it is now time for us to decide what legacy we will pass on to our children and the generations of Minnesotans that will follow them. Instead of the challenge of the frontier, we are now facing the challenge of a world in change.
Today our immediate focus is on the recession. It has affected all of us. Many Minnesotans have lost jobs and families are stretching their days and their pocketbooks to make ends meet. You do not need to be told that Minnesota's economy has seen better days. You know the reality.
But as a people, we have overcome much greater obstacles in our history. Many of us lived through the Great Depression. I can recall the end of the Depression when my mother would collect bags of discarded flour to bake bread and cookies to sell so that our family could pay the rent. It was not an easy time, but because our faith was strong and our values true - all of us endured.
As recently as the early 1980s Minnesota weathered a recession even more severe than the one we face today. Tens of thousands more people were unemployed then, and farm income fell to the lowest level since the Great Depression. But again we recovered, just as we will recover together from the hard times we are now facing.
This recession, like all recessions, will have limited duration. And we will recover because the fabric of our society is solid, our work ethic is strong, and we will stand together to make the sacrifices necessary to pull ourselves and our neighbors through. Tonight I will outline some of the actions we can take to attack the recession, and start putting Minnesotans back to work now.
But I am also convinced that we are facing a challenge much more significant than the recession. It is a challenge that goes to the heart of our tradition as an immigrant society.
For decades, the triumph of our lives has been the ability to give each new generation a better quality of life than the one we enjoyed. That ascending ladder has been a central part of the American experience. Today it is widely accepted that our children will be the first generation in American history to receive less from their parents than the generation before - the first generation to have fewer opportunities than we had when we were growing up.
More of our young people are worried about the future than ever before - 77%, according to one recent study. They worry because we have convinced them that they should. We lack confidence in the long-term future, and we are teaching our children to doubt
Yet in our hearts we all believe the United States and Minnesota in particular are the best places in the world to live and raise a family. What we need to do is remind ourselves of a simple fact - the state of the state will be whatever we choose to make it
The state of the state will be whatever we choose to make it

We can leave our children a state that is substantially stronger than the one w~ inherited - just as our parents did - if we are willing to draw upon the strength and integrity that have historically made this state and its people so exceptional. Children are our most important asset and we can measure our progress in the way our decisions affect their future.
The key to assuring that strength lies in identifying our objectives and making the decisions necessary to achieve them - no matter how tough those choices might be. It lies in recognizing that the good of Minnesota's people is more important than the good of any candidate or political party - and toning down political rhetoric so we can concentrate on the needs of our people.
Even amidst the rancor of the last legislative session, some very important things were accomplished:
· We identified K-12 education and early learning as priorities and - despite the need to close a $2 billion dollar shortfall we increased funding for both of these programs.
· We passed the most comprehensive wetlands protection bill in the nation.
· We advanced the cause of children by increasing funding for early childhood programs by $14 million.
· We increased funding for our children's health plan to allow coverage for 24,000 more children.
· We sent a signal to job creators by reducing commercial and industrial property tax rates.
· We adopted the nation's strongest grade crossing safety legislation.
· We began the difficult process of property tax reform by eliminating the 3% tax classification. And we had to do that because senior. citizens on fixed incomes were literally being taxed out of their homes.
· And we solved a $2 billion dollar shortfall without the strikes, massive lay-offs, shutdowns and costly special sessions that plagued so many other states.
To the members of the legislature who worked on those achievements, I say thank you for putting the future of Minnesota first.
The challenge of defining the Minnesota of the 90s is just beginning. Next week we start a legislative session that provides us with an eight week opportunity to look at our future and shape the state of the state on issues like health care access, education, and jobs. We can also squander the opportunity presented by that session with partisan rhetoric and political debate. It's our choice, and you and I need to work together to take the high road and make this session make a difference.
Nowhere can we make a more significant difference than by improving the quality of education.
When I was young, my immigrant parents told us education was the great leveling factor. They were right. Education brought my brothers and me out of poverty. It has brought generations of Americans out of poverty and it remains the single most reliable ticket to self-sufficiency and a rewarding life.
Among the fifty states, Minnesota's K-12 education system is universally recognized as an innovative leader. But unfortunately, being a leader in the nation is no longer good enough.
When our children graduate they will not compete simply with people from Iowa or North Dakota. Even if they never leave Minnesota - they will compete with students from Asia; Europe, and Canada. And if we expect them to win, we are going to have to change, and make our education system competitive with any in the world.
Minnesota 2000 is a program designed to drive that change. It is a statewide campaign to get every aspect of every community involved in the education process. It was inspired by an African proverb that states: "It takes an entire village to educate one child." That philosophy is the foundation of Minnesota 2000. Simply put, our goal is to improve education by increasing the level of community involvement.
We have set six ambitious education goals for Minnesota. And we intend to achieve these goals by the year 2000.
· First, all children should start school ready to learn.
· Second, every high school in the state should have a 90 percent graduation rate.
· Third, our students should master challenging academic subjects including English, math, science and geography.
· Fourth, our students must be first in math and science achievement.
· Fifth, every adult should be literate and possess the skills necessary to compete in a global economy.
· And finally, we must remove drugs and violence from our schools.
Our aim is nothing less than raising achievement to world-class levels for all learners. Are these optimistic goals? You bet they are. But they are achievable.

Last fall, 200 teachers, administrators, social workers, clergy, businessmen and. women, civic organizations, volunteers and parents assisted in the planning process for Minnesota 2000. Regional meetings will begin across Minnesota in April. I plan to attend, and I hope you will join me.
It is going to take this kind of effort to get education back where it should be - at the center of family and community life.
Minnesota 2000 defines an exciting vision. And that vision becomes more exciting when we blend it with the work of the children's commission I appointed one year ago.
Teachers tell us that increasing numbers of children are beginning their schooling unready to learn for reasons that have nothing to do with their learning abilities. More and more children are coming to school sick, hungry, tired distracted or abused. Too often TV has become the babysitter. And too often teachers and government are being asked to assume the role of a "parent".
Teachers cannot be expected to teach hungry children, and they cannot be expected to excite the mind of a child with low self-esteem. It's time to give teachers some help rather than blame them for problems over which they have no control.
We also have learned that bureaucracies - no matter how caring - cannot raise our children. We need to recognize that the challenge of learning readiness does not begin on the first day of school. It begins with the parent. We must develop an environment in which children can succeed in a value based system that reflects parental commitment.
Much of what we need to do is simple and accessible to every Minnesota family.
· We can make a point to spend quality time with each child 
· We can turn off the TV and help our children explore the world of reading 
· We can take our children to the zoo, the museum, the art gallery
It is as easy as taking a walk, going sledding or simply talking to one another..
While parents have an obligation to parent, we in government and in the community have an obligation to help responsible families succeed. And there is a great deal more we can do to help.
Minnesota is viewed as the leader in the nation when it comes to effective children's programs. We are not short on programs. We are not short on good programs. But we may be short on the coordination, flexibility and depth needed to turn children's lives around.
That is why we formed a children's commission last year - called Action for Children - to study the lives of young Minnesotans and make recommendations to help the state restructure programs and remove barriers to success for children and their families.
This commission will soon issue its first report which includes a broad range of recommendations, many of which deal with building bridges between programs, parents, children teachers and social workers.
Among the recommendations are: .
· Formation of a Children's Cabinet drawn from the state departments which affect children most. This group would assist in developing children's policies and budgeting children's programs.
· Integration of education, school, health and social services for children of all ages.
· Creation of an information system that is integrated across state agencies so that important information does not get lost when children move from program to program - and so that programs can coordinate their efforts.

The first report from the Children's Commission offers many sound ideas ... but perhaps most important, it brings us to the realization that we cannot isolate education from other problems affecting children. If a child is doing poorly in school - it may have little to do with the child's intelligence and a lot to do with low self-esteem or a serious problem at home. The state of the family reflects the state of the state.
We have the capacity to improve. We can take advantage of innovative programs like Communities-in-Schools - a program that grants funding to schools who bring social service programs into the school setting. And we can transport that model all across Minnesota. It's about time we combined social services and education to help those who need special help while allowing others to pursue their education without distraction.
We can expand our early learning programs such as Head Start. Our objective should be that every child has access to a nutritious breakfast. We must also make certain that every child has access to affordable health care.
When we open doors for children today, we open doors for the remainder of their lives.
But unfortunately, as important as it is for us to provide each child with access to opportunity, these measures alone will not build a strong future for the state if our children have to leave Minnesota to find the kinds of jobs they have been trained for. And we cannot preserve the unique diversity of our society if children educated in Greater Minnesota are forced to migrate to the Twin Cities to find work.
The truth is that the issues of education and job climate are inseparable. And in Minnesota, our job climate is as weak as our educational system is strong. A recent analysis of the national business climate rated Minnesota the most desirable place in the nation to live. But that same publication rated us as one of the ten worst states in the nation for job growth because of our high taxes, high workers' compensation costs, and a difficult regulatory climate.
9

The job climate issue touches each of our lives because every month, every year, jobs leave this state and Minnesota companies undertake their expansions elsewhere. And no single factor has played a greater role in costing Minnesota jobs than our high workers' compensation costs.
Minnesota workers compensation costs are 35 percent higher than those in Wisconsin, and 43 percent above costs in South Dakota - two of the principal states with which we compete. A major employer in South East Minnesota recently told me that he could save over $300,000 a year simply by moving his company a few hundred yards across the river to Wisconsin. Another bewildered company owner in South West Minnesota showed me how he could cut his workers compensation costs by 70 percent if he moved across the border into Iowa. Fortunately, they chose to stay. Many others chose to leave.
There is no reason the workers' compensation problem cannot be fixed in this legislative session if we have the courage to make the choice. There is a bipartisan proposal now before the legislature that would reform Minnesota's system and bring our costs into line with those of our principal competitors. It would no longer pay people more to stay home than to work. It controls medical costs without requiring additional state subsidies. And it makes the system easier to use and understand for workers who are injured on the job. I support that proposal.
In the late 1980s the legislature three times passed meaningful workers' compensation reform only to have it vetoed by the former Governor. I want to make it very plain that if the legislature passes the bi-partisan reform package, I will sign it. And with joblessness increasing across Minnesota, I cannot think of a reason for failing to act on the bill during this session. There is no more effective way to keep Minnesota jobs in Minnesota.
An equally strong priority for this legislative session is health care reform.
There are few needs as basic as the need for access to affordable health care. You and I are fortunate to live in a national health care center. People travel from around the world to access institutions like Rochester Mayo Clinic and St. Mary's Medical Center. Minnesota's medical provider community is large and diverse and our emphasis on prevention has produced health insurance rates 18 - 23 percent below the national average.
But these advantages are meaningless to the nearly seven percent of Minnesotans who have no medical coverage of any kind. And' with medical costs increasing between two and three times the rate of inflation each year, that seven percent figure is not likely to go down. Rising costs are pressuring Minnesota business at every level, and placing a growing burden on more than 17,000 self-employed farmers who lack legal authority to deduct more than a small percentage of their health insurance premiums.
I believe there is a national consensus in support of health care reform, and the time to begin that reform is now. Several months ago I prepared and legislative leaders introduced a plan called "HEART', which will phase in reforms designed to bring health care coverage within the financial reach of every Minnesota family. Other legislators, health providers and several business groups have offered similar, innovative proposals. The time has come for us to forget about pride of authorship, recognize that we are all working toward the same goal, and begin turning these proposals into reality.
The "health care crisis" is really two issues - assuring health care access, and controlling health care costs. I want the legislature to adopt legislation addressing both issues in the upcoming legislative session. At a minimum, that bill should:
· Provide every Minnesota child with access to affordable health care by removing financial barriers to health care coverage for Minnesota's 70,000 uninsured children.
· Give Minnesota farmers and other self-employed workers a fair shake by reforming the Tax Code to permit them to deduct 100% of their health insurance costs.
· Grant relief to small businesses by authorizing a basic health coverage package free from the multiple state mandates that are driving insurance costs out of the reach of so many independent businesses.
· Provide mechanisms to increase access to basic health care services in rural Minnesota.
· Include meaningful and realistic cost containment provisions.
Finally, it is essential that the bill have a financing mechanism that will cover its costs without requiring us to cut back other programs like education or human services to pay for the health care plan.
The HEART proposal achieves every one of these objectives.
We all recognize that Minnesota lacks the financial resources to resolve the entire health care access issue in a single year. But that is not a reason to delay beginning the process of finding a solution.
We are already recognized as the national leader in the quality of our health care system. There is no reason why we cannot adopt a plan in this legislative session that will make us the national leader in assuring access to that system.
We can also make meaningful improvement in our quality of life by adopting thoughtful reforms in our violence prevention, correction and crime victims assistance programs.
Last year, the incidence of violent crime, hate crimes and domestic abuse in Minnesota increased substantially. That is out of character with our society, and we need to reverse this trend before the public safety in the Twin Cities deteriorates as it has in other growing metropolitan areas.

Yesterday a group of legislative leaders joined me in announcing a comprehensive public safety package. Included in that package of more than sixty recommendations are:
· Greater protection for domestic assault victims.
· Truth in sentencing guidelines and strengthened penalties for DWI and crimes against people.
· Streamlined record-keeping systems to assist police in identifying and arresting suspects more quickly.
· Making sure that the sentence in any property related crime must include restitution of the losses of the victim.
A society that lives in fear has no quality of life. The recommendations in this package can stem the trend toward violent crime before it changes our society. Differences among legislators on these issues are not unresolvable, and I expect the legislature to pass a public safety improvement package before it adjourns this spring.
But we cannot lose sight of the fact that the responsibility for a violence free Minnesota goes beyond the legislature. While legislators do their part, you and I must do ours. The root causes of violence in our society begin in the home, on the playgrounds and on neighborhood streets. We each contribute to the tolerance of violence in subtle ways. The most important thing we can do to break the cycle of violence is to change our own attitudes. That means rejecting actions as subtle as a cruel word spoken in the home, or as vicious as the hate mail being directed toward minority groups in the Minneapolis community. There is no place for either in our society, and we need to stand together and say it.
The effort to make Minnesota violence free cannot be limited to a single week. It is a lifetime effort, with success and failure resting in your hands and mine. In crime as in so many other areas, the state of this state in future years is ours to
shape - and I think we are equal to the challenge.
While we work together to achieve these long-term reforms, there are immediate needs in Minnesota that must be addressed.
The effects of the national recession are being felt in every comer of this state. By national standards, our problem is not severe; our unemployment rate is 30 percent below the national average. But by Minnesota standards the human impact of these numbers is not acceptable.
No one should be naive enough to believe that a state the size of Minnesota can single-handedly affect the course of the national economy. But we do have a moral obligation to do everything within our power to lessen the impact of recession on our people. Through some simple common sense actions, we can provide jobs for thousands of Minnesotans right now, when they are needed most. And taking those actions should be the legislature's first priority when it returns on February 18.
There are more than $155 million dollars in labor intensive capital construction projects planned in Minnesota over the next two years. The need for those projects is not in dispute; many are already authorized. What we need to do is accelerate the construction schedule for these projects so they can begin now, when we need the jobs, rather than next year or the year after.
Although Minnesota's bonding authority is limited to three percent of revenues, we can also issue approximately $75 million dollars in capital construction bonds for badly needed schools and public infrastructure projects without exceeding the 3 percent limit.
These actions, taken together, would immediately create between 6,000 and 8,000 jobs. And because they involve accelerating projects rather than new spending programs, they will not worsen the budget shortfall, and will not require us to cut back other programs.

I have already issued an Executive Order authorizing the acceleration of $55 million dollars in labor intensive construction contracts. Those contracts will put approximately 2,000 Minnesota families to work. But I cannot implement the rest of the program without legislative approval.
This jobs bill is a fiscally sound way to create jobs for thousands of Minnesota families. It will pump tens of millions of dollars into our economy when our economy needs it most. I have made no secret of the fact that I am extremely disappointed that the legislature did not find time to act on this program during its January session. Families are hurting, and they need help now.
It's time for us to put politics and past disputes behind at least on this issue. When the legislature returns next week, let's work together to get this program adopted. We can all share the credit, as Minnesota's workers and their families share its benefits.
Unfortunately, while we pursue these opportunities we also have to face the difficult task of putting our own financial house in order.
Just as the recession has affected Minnesota workers, it. has affected the state itself. Income tax revenues are running more than $400 million dollars below projected levels, giving us a recession induced budget shortfall of approximately $343 million dollars. And frankly, the shortfall could increase when the February 28 forecast is released. We have no choice but to close that shortfall.
Why? The simple answer is that Minnesota law does not permit the state to carry a shortfall into the next biennium. But even if we had that authority, we would have to close the shortfall because of the damage it would do to every one of us if we resorted to long term borrowing.
The borrowing necessary to close this shortfall would cost Minnesota taxpayers between $100 and $120 million dollars in interest between now and the end of the next biennium. That represents over $100 million tax dollars that do not go to housing, do not go to education, and do not go to health care. They would instead be consumed in interest payments to whoever is willing to loan several hundred million dollars. to the state. That would be an indefensible use of taxpayer money.
It is also essential to remember that borrowing would lower Minnesota's bond rating - driving up the cost of schools, hospitals, highways and other capital improvements built with state bonds.
Failure to close the shortfall would make it more costly for Minnesota to maintain its social investments and its quality of life. It would also be the best way to ensure that our children will not have access to the same level of economic opportunity that we have enjoyed.
Unfortunately, there is no painless way to put the budget back in balance. There are only two ways to close the shortfall - spending reductions, or higher taxes. And I will do everything in my power to avoid a general tax increase.
I am going to have to propose remedies I do not want to propose, and the legislature will adopt spending cuts that. it doesn't want to vote on. But as Harriet Bishop discovered a century and a half ago, building the future requires sacrifices, difficult decisions and the courage to make the right choices. And I am well aware that you did not elect any public official to make only the easy decisions. I will do everything I can to minimize the pain, but there will be pain. We will cut back not because we want to but because we have to. And I sincerely hope we can achieve that solution through a bipartisan agreement.
Recession response, health care reform, workers' compensation reform, educational improvement and a better crime prevention program. These are Minnesota's priorities, and they are all achievable in the next legislative session. We can also elect not to act, if that's our choice. The state of the state, and the quality of life in our society, will be whatever we chose to make them. But I have no doubt that we are equal to the challenge of providing our children an even better future and an even stronger state than the one we inherited.Madam Speaker, fellow constitutional officers, former governors, members of the Supreme Court, and its newest member, Alan Page; appellate court justices under the new leadership of Paul Anderson; members of the Minnesota Legislature and especially our 50 new legislators - I want to say thank you for your commitment to serve.

I believe 1993 will be a year when we will be proud to say that we are Minnesotans. My optimism is based on the record that we have built together over the past two years:

· Today we have a health care system in Minnesota that is accessible and affordable to all hard-working families.

· We value our beautiful Minnesota environment so much that we protect it through the most comprehensive wetlands laws in the nation. It was our record in the area of water quality that motivated the National Audubon Society to honor our administration with an award for excellence in the environment - the only American elected official to receive this award in the last five years.

· We learned, and some may say we learned the hard way, that it is too expensive for companies to exist, let alone expand in Minnesota... so we reduced rates for worker's compensation and reduced the rates for commercial industrial property taxes.

· We said we're fed up and we're not going to take it anymore when it comes to crime. We now have stiffer penalties for a variety of crimes, particularly rape. We have put more dollars into violence prevention. And now we are seeking new laws against stalkers.

· And when it comes down to making those tough choices during the tightest financial times I've seen as an elected official, we have protected the funding for our children's education. We know what matters.

And we will close the gap between anticipated revenues and expenditures without a tax increase.
This is what happens when we choose to work together.
This legislature has earned a reputation for being visionary. When I talk to other governors and hear their stories I am reminded of how fortunate I am to work with a body that time and again shows that it knows how to get things done for the people of Minnesota.
We have proven that we can rise above the gridlock. And we will do it again. We must fmd the direct route to change and improvement in order to address the challenges that lie ahead.
Since becoming governor in 1991, I have spent a great deal of time listening to Minnesotans describe their concerns, their challenges, and most importantly, what their dreams are for the future. I listened as they talked and I heard Minnesotans say they want three things:
· First, people are concerned about getting and keeping good jobs. Those who have lost their jobs are suffering. Those who have had to settle for low-paying jobs are hurting. And those who have good jobs are worried about losing them. All of us can identify with what a job means to a family. That is why last month I proposed a plan that will help employers, especially small businesses, create more jobs for Minnesotans, the people who I believe are the most productive workers in America.
· Second, Minnesotans told me that they want to protect and enhance our very special quality of life - from our pristine natural resources to our exciting diversity of cultural attractions.
· And finally, a theme that resonated in every town from Rochester to Roseau as we traveled around the state for Minnesota Milestones: We want to say to every child, 'You can be anything you want to be.' We want to see every child come to school ready to learn, we want families to provide a stable environment for their children, we want all our children to be healthy and we want every young person to gain the skills needed to Compete in a global economy.


Tonight I want to focus this State of the State speech on the subject I hold closest to my heart - the needs of our children.
Two years ago, I appointed a commission to take a hard look at how we serve our children and their families. Under the leadership of Ron James and my wife Susan, the Action for Children Commission has turned out to be an excellent example of the results that can be accomplished through a partnership among businesses, communities, advocates for children and government.
In the course of its work, the commission tried to answer two simple questions: First, how much money are we, as a state, spending each year on children? Second, what kinds of results are we getting?
The commission identified at least 250 children's programs, administered through 33 different state agencies, boards and commissions, costing Minnesota taxpayers $4.5 billion dollars a year.
Over the years, with the very best of intentions, we have created a tangled, bureaucratic web of children's programs. I would guess that not one of us in this chamber can name all of them. We have created too many individual government specialty shops. And we invite our customers to wait in line to see if they might be able to squeeze into the narrow product we are selling. If they cannot, they trudge on to the next shop.
Families and children who need help are frustrated by the complexity of the system and often do not get the kind of help they need. They end up working with dozens of case workers, counselors and eligibility specialists who are connected back to a confusing maze of inflexible programs. Our children are being divided into pieces by a system that is largely government centered and difficult to use.
And what are the results? Too many of our children are failing. Maybe they aren't your children or mine, but in every school there are children who are being left behind. And when these young people act out, they affect the way all our children learn. Eventually, we all pay for failed outcomes.


Every child deserves our very best. Nowhere is there more hope and potential than in the curious face of a two-year old, and nowhere is there more tragedy than in the angry face of a 13 year-old who cannot adequately read, nor more disappointment than in the face of a 17-year-old who has just been told he has no marketable job skills.
We need to give our young people more options.
Gwen Marshall from Minneapolis is just one example. Gwen graduated years ago with average grades from North High School. She was married, had a daughter, and was later divorced. As a single parent, she worked full-time during the day and sometimes held evening jobs in retail sales. Eventually the draining routine, the day care payments and being away from her young daughter got to be too much, so she quit her jobs and went on AFDC.
To her credit, Gwen enrolled in a skilled trades program at St. Paul Technical College last year, 17 years after she graduated from high school. She will complete the program this summer and someday wants to teach at a high school or a technical college. I have met Gwen, and I am confident she will attain any goal to which she aspires. She is with us this evening. Gwen Marshall in the center balcony.
But we have not been fair to the Gwen Marshalls of Minnesota, and there are many of them. Today I would like to promise you Gwen that we can and we will give your daughter more career options.
In my own life, education has meant everything. If it were not for the unique opportunities that I had, and the sturdy encouragement I received from my parents, I know this: I would not be here tonight, and I suspect the same is true for most of you.
Gwen's story illustrates that the system that has served most of us and our parents so well for so long is no longer adequate. In Minnesota, we can arid must do better.
The high-performance employers of today demand high skills from every employee at every level. Employers allover the state are telling me they cannot find the kinds of qualified workers they need. They are frustrated by the widening skills gap.


· The results of a recent Trade and Economic Development survey tell us that 70 percent of Minnesota companies report difficulty in recruiting skilled and technical workers.
· In a brand new survey of 351 Minnesota businesses conducted by the Minnesota Business Partnership, 52 percent of Twin Cities employers believe today's job applicants lack adequate basic skills in reading, writing and math.
Ninety percent said they would like to see Minnesota high school graduates be
certified as meeting minimum standards.
· Another large Minnesota employer reports that 75 percent of the Minnesota youth applying for jobs with their company cannot pass the company's basic employment exam.
· A manager of one of Minnesota's most prestigious technology companies told us his company finds better qualified high school graduates in Guadalajara, Mexico, than in Minnesota. That bothers me.
We do not have a job shortage in Minnesota - we have a skills shortage. And I fear that this skills shortage will eventually drive high-skills jobs out of the state.
This is not the fault of our children. It is not the fault of our teachers or schools or communities. The blame largely rests with a fragmented system that sends out mixed messages to our children; a system that has not yet recognized that our children will compete in a world economy.
Our young people deserve a bigger, better package of education and training possibilities. Students need linkages to the rapidly changing, increasingly technological world.
In Minnesota, we have begun to address some of these problems. We have created, for the first time, a Children's Cabinet consisting of all the state government department heads whose agencies provide services to children and families. This executive level cabinet has taken an inventory of all children's programs in the state and formulated Minnesota's first integrated children's budget.


I can assure you that this budget, which reflects the needs of Minnesota's children, will be
my number one priority this session. We will protect our overall spending on children from budget cuts.
In other areas too, Minnesota's leadership on behalf of children is being recognized on the national level.
· We are a leading candidate to receive a multi-million dollar grant from a major national foundation to completely reinvent the way we serve families and children.
· A team of Minnesota educators will receive up to $14 million from a national fund to design new kinds of schools that will serve as community learning centers for people of all ages.
· We are distinctive among all states in our commitment to Head Start. Minnesota is one of only a handful of states that invest in Head Start beyond what the federal government gives us. And we increased our commitment by 30 percent last year.
But we need to do more.
TONIGHT I AM PROPOSING THE NEXT LOGICAL STEP - TO BRING TOGETHER, FOR THE FIRST TIME, PROGRAMS THAT ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES.
What I am proposing tonight is nothing less than an overhaul of our system from top to bottom - an agenda for change, to keep Minnesota in a national leadership position on children and families, and to prepare our young people for the work force of the 21st Century.
Our administration is committed to putting our customers first, and in Minnesota, children are our number one customer. It is time we reorganize around the needs of today's child, to start with the child, and carefully build out from there a complement of services at the local level that makes sense and leads to successful, confident kids.


I recognize these proposals are significant, and therefore will not pass without a great deal of controversy and spirited debate. But Representative Willard Munger told me two years ago, and I quote, "If something isn't controversial, it's probably no damn good anyway." I tend to agree with you, Willard.
WHAT WE ARE PROPOSING IS TO CREATE A NEW DEPARTMENT - THE MINNESOTA DEPARTMENT OF CHILDREN AND EDUCATION SERVICES.
Let me repeat that. We are proposing to create a new department - the Minnesota Department of Children and Education Services - to address the needs of the total child, from
infancy through the teenage years. Creating a new department will mean dramatically
changing, and in some cases, abolishing, existing agencies. But we cannot let long-standing battles over turf and reverence for institutions stop us from taking meaningful steps for children and their families.
What will this mean to children and families who need help? It will mean that for the first time, there will be a single agency responsible for cutting through the bureaucratic tape on behalf of children. It will mean that a single agency head can be held accountable for producing better results. It will mean that· families can be more assured of finding and getting comprehensive help in one convenient location. And it will mean that every child will have a better shot at success.
Changes are already taking place in Minnesota that reflect this new approach of putting children, not systems, first. This new department will support those community-based efforts. We have learned that some of the most effective programs, such as Head Start, work best because they involve families in all aspects of the program and they rely on local community involvement.
We will use this philosophy throughout the Department of Children and Education Services as we bring in programs in addition to Head Start such as Early Childhood Family Education, Early Childhood Screening, Learning Readiness, Way to Grow, Even Start, the Children's Trust Fund and a host of others that focus on those critical years in a child's life from birth to kindergarten enrollment.
By reinventing the way we serve these young children, we will begin to make some sense out of a fragmented, disjointed system.


In addition to reorganizing at the state level, we will offer incentives to local officials, Community Action agencies, schools, parents and non-profits to forge a new partnership around the needs of children and families. Our budget proposal, which will be unveiled in 12 days, will include $10 million dollars in new grants to be awarded to communities who develop collaborative ways to help children and responsible families succeed, and who make a commitment to measuring results for children.
Because education is such an important part of our children's lives, we invite educators to join in a dynamic partnership with the whole array of other children's services. To do this, we will propose that the education services currently provided by the Department of Education be incorporated into the new Department of Children and Education Services.
This new department will carry forward the commitment we have made to make our
education system one that is driven by results.
We have talked about standards in education long enough. It is time to take action. To set
standards. To set them high, and to measure the results.
Having serious, measurable standards will assure us that no child will slide through high school without basic skills. These new benchmarks ultimately will bring a more individualized approach to teaching and learning, because once these standards are in place, the state is going to step back and simply send the money and resources educators need to help students achieve this level of competency.
No more micro-management. No more state regulations about how many hours of French or geography a child needs. We will stop piling on our teachers every social goal that should be delivered by families, churches and other institutions.
We are going to let local schools do their jobs. We will free teachers up to teach. Our focus at the state level will only be on outcomes.
We will ask the Department of Children and Education Services to determine and assess educational standards so that by about the 10th grade, our students will have mastered a rigorous set of academic skills. As students pass through this gateway of achievement, we can be assured that every one of them has the basic skills needed to proceed on to the next level.


In addition to assuring that no child is left behind in their early years, we must begin to address the job training needs of our young adults. Which brings me to the next major part of our proposal this evening, and it has to do with 'how we prepare our young people for the high-skill, high-wage jobs of tomorrow.
I PROPOSE THAT MINNESOTA MOVE AGGRESSIVELY TO CREATE OUR OWN SYSTEM OF YOUTH APPRENTICESHIPS - THAT WE FORGE A NEW PARTNERSHIP WITH BUSINESS, EDUCATION, LABOR AND GOVERNMENT THAT WILL WIDEN THE OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE TO OUR YOUNG PEOPLE.
I am proposing tonight that we commit to giving our young people more meaningful options while they are in high school - options that will compel them to stay in school, work hard, gain hands-on training in a high-skill occupation and, at the end of four years, secure a well-paying job.
To the 20 percent of Minnesotans who complete a four-year degree, our education system may appear to be working just fine. But 80 percent of Minnesotans never complete such a degree. We need a new focus on the 16- to 20-year-olds who are at risk of leaving the education system without the skills needed to enter a secure high-wage career.
We need to place a special emphasis on reaching out to our at-risk youth - children of color, children in poverty, children who learn best in a hands-on environment, children who now are falling through the cracks of our system into a future of despair.
With a youth apprenticeship program in place, students will have the option of pursuing college preparation courses or a combination of academic classes and hands-on job training during their last two years of high school.
Will this kind of learning program trap our kids into making narrow, one-way choices? Absolutely not. Will it give all teenagers and young adults more options? You bet.
Work-based learning will put a solid floor under a young person's career. Many will take this experience and go on to a college or university later. That is how it works in Europe. For example, one third of all practicing engineers in Germany went through apprenticeship programs first, and then went on to the university for further education.


This youth apprenticeship program will also be coordinated by the new Department of Children and Education Services.
In my budget message later this month I will also propose establishing Education and Training Accounts for every young Minnesotan. For those students whose families are less able to save for training and education, we will contribute to their accounts. We will challenge philanthropies, employers and parents to save through these accounts so that no young person will stand at the threshold of training opportunities without the resources to participate.
This new department will serve as a school-to-work bridge for students; linking students with training and linking trained students with good jobs.
We recognize that industry, in partnership with labor and educators, is the key to this youth apprenticeship program. For employers who participate, this means finding new resources for training and finding the money in today's tough economic climate to pay the wages that students will earn during training.
But business will ultimately see that, long term, this is an investment that brings powerful returns.
Honeywell has already stepped forward with an offer to open up 80 apprenticeship spots within their Minnesota facilities. Jim Renier, CEO of Honeywell is with us tonight, and on behalf of all Minnesotans I want to say thank you Jim, for your leadership.
Minnesota employers have established a number of meaningful partnerships with local high schools, technical schools and colleges. But tonight I am calling upon them to do much more.
Now we must also recognize that government alone will never be good at rearing children. Every sector of the community must playa role.
Parents, especially, must take an active role. There is only one place where children can learn that they are lovable, capable human beings, and that is at home. It is up to parents to teach their children the importance of responsibility and the rewards of hard work.


Our young people must come to grips with the fact that learning demands their rigorous participation. It does not occur through osmosis, it is not a spectator sport and it is not free. Minnesota taxpayers are paying more than $6,000 per year to educate each student and we expect hard work in return. I want to make sure that students are working hard on their .education.
It was shocking to me to learn that Minnesota leads the nation in the number of youth employed in the work force, with 69 percent of Minnesota teenagers working an average of 24 hours a week. Teachers tell me that these students come to school tired and unprepared. The 1992 Minnesota Student Survey confirms that grades drop off dramatically for those students who work 20 or more hours per week. This tells us that too many young people today are being held back by peer pressure to earn money and by a culture tied to cars, clothes and CDs.
We must introduce a new seriousness into the business of learning and communicate that seriousness to our kids. We will propose legislation this month to limit youth who have not yet completed high school from working more than 20 hours per week during the school year.
IN SUMMARY, TONIGHT I HAVB OUTLINED A PROPOSAL THAT WILL BRING TOGETHER THREE DYNAMIC SUPPORT SYSTEMS INTO ONE COHESIVE DEPARTMENT FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH.
· First we will bring together all those critical programs for our youngest children before they enter kindergarten.
· To this we will add educational programming for elementary and secondary students with an emphasis on setting rigorous academic standards for all students.
· And then we will add the third piece, and what is now the missing link, career preparation in the form of youth apprenticeship training for our young adults.
This new department will support a seamless, community-based approach to serving young people in Minnesota.

It is an ambitious agenda, and I look forward to discussing these proposals and others with you. But there is a sense of urgency. Our work force is in stiff competition with workers in other countries. Real wages in America have declined in the past 20 years. I know that President-elect Bill Clinton understands these issues very well, because I have worked with him and the governors of other states to put these issues on the national agenda. I say tonight to President-elect Clinton: Minnesota is ready to work with you to lead the nation in making America's work force the best in the world. What we're talking about tonight is a new team effort, and every player must pitch in and work hard in order to win - government, business, parents, children, all of us. If we start today and work together, our kids will come out on top. Thank you very much.Thank you Mayor Hazama. Speaker-Designate Anderson, fellow constitutional officers, Governor Harold Stassen, Governor Elmer Anderson, members of the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals, members of the Minnesota Legislature and friends.
Nearly four years ago, I called Joanell Dyrstad and asked her to be my running mate as lieutenant governor. I feel extremely fortunate, and Minnesotans are fortunate, that she chose to say yes that day. She has served our state and its people with a great deal of intelligence, tenacity and concern for the real issues that affect people., It was with great regret that I accepted her decision to run for the U.S. Senate, but I respect that decision and wish her all the very best.
Lieutenant Governor Dyrstad, thank you ever so much.
Thank you all for being here with me in Rochester, the best place to live in the entire country according to Money Magazine, and probably according to many of you here today. We came here because the Rochester area represents so much of what is good and so much of what is changing in our state.
Rochester is home to a vital computer industry that has and will continue to thrive amid turbulence; and it is also home to a world-renowned health care giant, the Mayo Clinic, which exemplifies Minnesota's reputation for excellence.
This is an important day for all of Minnesota as we reflect on where we are, and where it is that we want to be as we approach the 21st century.

As I stand here today, I can say, with more confidence than I have had since the 1970s, that Minnesota is back on track. And we now have an unparalleled opportunity to forge ahead... into a future that is certain to be brighter for ourselves and for our children.
Two months ago, I became a grandfather for the very first time. I honestly did not expect it to be quite such a moving experience. Having a new little granddaughter only reaffirmed what I have known for years - that our job is to do what is right for the longterm. and build a better Minnesota to leave to our children:
· We want it to be a Minnesota in which violent crime is no longer an ever-present threat, where people know and care about one another and our streets and schools are safe.
· We want it to be a place where Minnesotans can find secure and promising jobs.
· And we want it to be a Minnesota in which your kids and my kids and their kids - our grandchildren - will know that if they are responsible, caring, honest and hard working - they will achieve their dreams.
Three years ago, when I delivered my first State of the State message, Minnesota was headed in the wrong direction.
Our administration inherited an immediate 200 million-dollar budget shortfall, and faced a 1.8 billion-dollar projected gap between spending and revenue. Today, three years later, we are looking at a projected surplus of 430 million dollars.
We chose the tough road, but it was the right road.
First, we put the brakes on runaway spending. During the 1980s, the growth in state government exceeded the growth in people's paychecks by 15 percent. Since then, we have frozen the number of state employees, held the growth of government to the growth in personal income, implemented a wage freeze, and cut welfare for able-bodied adults.


None of these things were easy. But if we had not made the tough choices when we did - we would have had. to raise taxes. And if we had chosen to solve the problem we inherited with income taxes, Minnesotans would have seen a permanent income tax increase of 23 percent - 340 dollars for every family of four with an income of $40,000. That is what we prevented. 
In the process, we' quickly became the target of nearly every entrenched and powerful spending system in Minnesota. And as we were being attacked by all the forces that resists change - it was then that I knew we were doing something right.
Today, Minnesota is back on track and charging ahead with vigor. We can all take pride in the fact that Financial World magazine just ranked Minnesota the third best managed state in America and we have regained our AAA credit rating.
We have set priorities: putting job creation, improving the lives of children and fighting crime at the top of our list.
In the past three years, we have taken dramatic steps that will enhance Minnesota's quality of life for years to come.
· Together with the Minnesota Legislature, we implemented sweeping health care reform to bring down the cost of health care for all Minnesotans without penalizing employers, taking away competition, or jeopardizing the outstanding quality of our health care in this state. Minnesota is now looked upon as a national model for health care reform.
· We have launched environmental policies that are nationally recognized, including the most comprehensive wetlands protection legislation in the country, and a far-reaching effort to clean up the Minnesota River.
· In the devastating floods of 1993 we all came together to help those affected. As chairman of the Midwestern Governors' Association, it was my privilege to lead a delegation of governors to Washington to tell congress about the very real, long-term impact of the floods on our people. As a result of that effort, we came home with 446 million dollars, or twice as much aid as Washington had intended to give us.

· I am proud of our work on behalf of Minnesota's children. Despite the state's severe financial crisis, we have directed substantially more resources to children each year, and we are spending those dollars much more effectively on programs that work .... on early learning, education, children's health, youth apprenticeship, parent education, child abuse prevention, child support enforcement and nutrition programs.
As I travel the state, visiting with Minnesota parentS and their children I realize how much more is left to be done.
· Today Minnesota has an nationally recognized education system that allows for school choice and charter schools, and we have talented, innovative educators who help our students to achieve world class test scores. Our post-secondary institutions now have a clear sense of purpose and are poised to meet the work force needs of the 21st century.
· We have kept our promises to those who create jobs by curbing the costs of doing business here, with a specific focus on reforming workers' compensation and reducing commercial and industrial property tax rates.
We helped Northwest Airlines through a critical time - maintaining the Twin Cities as one of the few major international transportation gateways in the country and preserving 17,000 direct jobs, plus another 60,000 that depend on the airline for survival.
Minnesota is clearly back on track. But one thing stands squarely in the way of our progress, and that is violent crime.
Unlike other crises we have faced, such as floods and bitter cold snaps, violence pulls us apart - not together -- and tugs at the core values that have made this state great. Violence has caused us to change our lifestyles, trust other people less, and to be afraid always for ourselves and our loved ones.


In 1992 and 1993 we took bold measures to stop violence in its tracks by passing the toughest and most comprehensive crime bill in Minnesota's history. We lengthened, and in many cases quadrupled, prison sentences for a long list of violent crimes involving murder, rape, possession of guns in schools, and drive-by shootings. We passed an antistalking law, giving women and other victims of stalking the means to put their assailants in jail.
We instituted a new truth-in-sentencing policy meaning that all convicted criminals serve all of their time. Thirty years means three decades under lock and key.
Many of us can fondly recall our own childhoods in a simpler time, when teachers cited their biggest discipline problems as students running in the halls and chewing gum in class, when neighbors relied on one another and kept an eye out for each other's children. And when murders were something that happened in faraway places, not to kids who live down the street.
How many of our veterans, who risked and lost lives on foreign soil, would have ever believed that the biggest threat to our safety would someday come from within our own communities? How many would have believed then that in 1994, a substantial percentage of Minnesotans would be afraid to walk at night in their own neighborhoods?
We cannot go back, but we can pull together. We can adopt realistic short- and longterm changes now that will restore our trust and remove dangerous predators from the streets.
A Minneapolis police officer recently told me he thought it was time we do more than manage crime. It's time we start fighting it.
H we are serious about fighting crime, we are going to have to make some changes:
· First, we must stop the six percent of the people who are committing 70 percent of the crimes. That means targeting our resources to the most dangerous -- the people we are afraid of.

· I have asked the legislature for a "three-time loser" law that guarantees a 15-year mandatory minimum sentence for those convicted of a third violent crime. With this law in place, it's three times, and you're off the streets and in prison for at least 15 years.
· We must aggressively deal with the 60 percent rise in juvenile crime since 1988.
· We must send a clear message that in Minnesota, violent criminals, young and old, will be held accountable.
· We must not wipe clean the records of serious juvenile offenders when they reach 18. And we must make absolutely certain that regardless of their age, cold calculated criminals are dealt with aggressively - as adults -- and with as much sympathy and compassion as they show their own victims.
Sixteen year-old Jason Williams is just one example. He had come into contact with at least 10 police departments before he broke into a Brooklyn Park home just over a year ago. He spent the entire day there, eating, drinking and watching television until the owner arrived home with her two small children.
Williams murdered her, then killed one of the children and left the other for dead.
He then took her car, her cash and her wedding ring and picked up his friends for an exciting night out on the town.
The pain of this nightmare will always remain. We cannot change that - only offer our support and our prayers. But we can change a juvenile justice system that failed to stop Jason Williams earlier - that failed to show him swift, sure consequences when he was arrested for theft and assault earlier.
What scares us more than the crimes sometimes are the attitudes of these young predators is the total lack of remorse. Existing laws are not effective in dealing with this tidal wave of brutal, violent youth.
6

I intend to create structured summer camps and reinforce community programs for those young people who are teetering on the edge. Youth workers tell me they can predict with a great deal of accuracy which children are most likely to fall into a life of crime. We must target our efforts, reach out, and catch these kids before they fall into life of street crime.
I want to dismantle ridiculous data privacy laws that prevent teachers, police and social workers from sharing basic information about dangerous young people. Today a police officer is required to tell school officials if a minor has been caught drinking beer, but that same officer is forbidden to let the school know if a kid is accused of murder.
We must give our teachers the assistance they need to maintain order in the classroom. They need the authority to use reasonable force to control violent young renegades who systematically shatter the learning process for all students. It is crazy that we have let some kids run the show for so long.
We can do all these things - make all these changes - in 1994, and they will have a tremendous impact. But prisons, prosecutors and punishment cannot stop the pipeline of children who are growing up angry, afraid and increasingly violent right now.
Violence is rooted in a fundamental breakdoWn of the family. Sure, there are other factors that perpetuate violence such as drugs, unemployment, alcohol and poverty. And certainly the media and the entertainment industry perpetuate violence with their glorification of murder and criminal behavior.
But thousands of strong families have overcome these obstacles and demonstrated that a strong and caring home life can give children the solid foundation they need, not just to endure all the risk factors, but to excel, to thrive and to succeed.
We cannot let Minnesota become a state of victims - always blaming government or teachers or social workers or police or employers for what happens to us. We can take charge of our destiny; and we are responsible for our actions.
We cannot be afraid to talk anew about values. Values are not something that died with our pioneering ancestors. Most of us believe very deeply in things like individual responsibility, mutual respect, hard work, trust and honesty. We believe in the inherent strength of families and we want close-knit communities.


We must take these values with us. They must be part of our future.
Government can reflect these values with a reconstructed welfare system. Last week I proposed a comprehensive reform plan that gives people who apply for welfare whether they have lived in Minnesota 20 years or two days - a job, not a check.
I have asked the legislature to reverse policies that now make Minnesota a magnet for people who choose not to work. Let's face the facts: 42 percent of those on welfare in Hennepin County moved here within the past year; and 600 convicted criminals in our state prisons lived in Minnesota less than two years before being sentenced. Minnesota taxpayers are tired of importing trouble and dependency from other states. It's time to close the gates.
We want to remove the barriers to working and the excuses for not working. We must get rid of all the backward incentives that now reward dependency, reward unemployment, reward having children out-of-wedlock and reward families who self-destruct.
The new system is designed to help people stand proudly on their own two feet with a broad range of support including health care, transportation and child care. But after two years, if you refuse to participate, then we refuse to prop you up anymore.
Government can support strong family values by holding both parents responsible for their kids:
· We must bluntly explain the realities of parenting to all our high school youth so they fully understand that having a child is a life-long emotional and financial commitment.
· We must continue to tighten-up child support enforcement to hold both parents responsible for the well-being of their children.
· We must require teenage moms who apply for welfare to live with their parents, and either work or go to school.
· And we must require parents to accompany their kids in court.


These are some of the things that government can do to reflect the values of responsibility and strong families in Minnesota.
still, all the government policies in the world cannot save us if we abandon values of individual responsibility.
Government cannot raise children.
Being a good parent today is one of the toughest jobs there is. To all Minnesota parents, including the divorced moms and dads, who manage to go to the parent-teacher conferences, coach the soccer teams arid take their kids camping - to those of you who are there for your kids, despite your own struggles, thank you. Your kids need you desperately, and Minnesota does too.
Strong families are the real key to a more cohesive, less violent future.
But there must be much more to our vision than stopping crime. Violence is a barrier, and as we overcome that formidable barrier we must commit ourselves to a plan that gives all of us reason to believe in tomorrow.
That vision must be one of opportunity - and jobs.
Everything we have come to cherish hinges upon our ability to grow and keep jobs in Minnesota - our schools, our health care, our state parks, our roads and the integrity and safety of our communities. A decent job can give a family independence, stability and a reason to dream about the future.
That is why jobs have been, and continue to be, the long-term focus of this administration.
When I talk about jobs, I am talking about good jobs -- jobs that require knowledge and skill - jobs that are rewarding, that pay well and offer opportunities for promotion. I am talking about entrepreneurs and small businesses, because they offer the greatest potential for more and better jobs in Minnesota.
We care about jobs, we must care deeply about education, because employers today need skilled, able and competent workers.


For the first time in decades, we are setting our academic sights higher in Minnesota with the development of new graduation standards. These standards are being drafted over the next several months. I want them to be clear, objective and easy to measure. I want them to reflect basic academic skills such as math, science, communications, and geography - abilities that our children need to compete in the world economy.
If we care about jobs, we must understand the urgency of the changes we need to make to bring down the cost of doing business here.
Minnesota workers are known for their hard work and high skills. So why is it that so many are constantly worried about holding on to their jobs? The answer is simple: it costs more to do business here.
In 1992 a total of 10 manufacturers - collectively employing nearly 900 people -- moved out of Minnesota: to South Dakota, Wisconsin, Nebraska, North Dakota, Kansas and Missouri. Eight of these 10 firms cited high workers compensation costs or burdensome taxes as the most significant factor in their overall decision to move.
We have made changes since then, but they are not nearly enough. We must bring down workers compensation costs this year. We will put a proposal before the legislature that we know will result in lower costs, higher efficiency and has proven to work in Wisconsin. This proposal.has had the support of both labor and management in that state for years.
I will ask each and every legislator to do that which they know is right, vote for jobs and vote "yes" on this proven reform plan.
If we care about jobs, we must take a long-term pledge not to raise taxes - not now and not for years to come. Government can and must live within its means.
In fact, this year I want to begin to phase out a burdensome sales tax on replacement capital equipment that penalizes manufacturers from expanding and creating new jobs in Minnesota. Computers and equipment don't pay taxes, people do. And this tax is hurting a lot of hard-working people.


These are critical steps to bringing jobs to Minnesota. But if we want to make more of these kinds of changes - changes that are good for people and good for jobs -- changes that lead to less government and more opportunity for people to succeed - then we need term limits in Minnesota.
When a legislator sits in the house or the senate for decades at a time, he or she can loose touch with the broad based concerns of people. Over time, the entrenched lawmaker accumulates far more power and influence than his newer colleagues and grows dependent upon powerful spending lobbies and special interest groups.
I am for term limits. But the legislature has repeatedly rejected my attempts to let Minnesotans vote on this issue. Members of the legislature, we must let the people decide, and decide in 1994.
· Because we care about jobs, we have begun to make government less of a barrier, and sometimes even a partner, in job growth.
· We can help bring technology and assistance to companies to help them increase productivity.
· We are creating one-stop shopping to help businesses find their way more quickly through the maze of government regulations.
· And we continue to promote Minnesota products and services around the globe.
Today Minnesota has a lot to say to the world.
When I visit with intemational leaders I tell them that Minnesota is back on track and open for business. 130,000 new Minnesota jobs have been created since 1991. We now rank ninth in the nation in job growth.
We have so much on which to build. Minnesota has a massive financial service industry, a vital bio-technology corridor, a growing list of environmental service companies, a dynamic printing industry, a booming medical alley, a renewed computer sector, a solid agri-business industry and a critical manufacturing base that is just starting to improve.
11

There is a new economic confidence in Minnesota that we have not seen in decades.
Banner Engineering is just one example -- a Plymouth company that just announced it will open a new plant in Fergus Falls, employing 150 people. Four years ago, when faced with the decision of where to locate a new plant, President and founder Bob Fayfield chose South Dakota.
This year, citing a turn-around in Minnesota's business climate, and a new pro-jobs attitude in state government he selected rural Minnesota. Bob is here today and I thank him for his confidence. But he says there is still much more to be done - and Bob, wholeheartedly agree.
The years just ahead hold out tremendous potential for Minnesota. We have every reason to believe that the best is not behind us, but rather lies directly ahead.
We will not get there by accident. You and I must commit ourselves to a path that will lead us to safe communities, strong families and good jobs. We must not be afraid to embrace the values that have made this state a shining star -- values of individual responsibility, respect, trust, hard work and honesty.
When I look at my own three children and my brand new granddaughter - I want so much for them. I want them to have more opportunities - more than I did. I want your children and my children and the young people here today to inherit a better world and a better state than we did. And I believe they will.
Minnesota is back on track. We know where we're going. Working together, we can get there from here.Mr. Speaker, President of the Senate, fellow constitutional officers, distinguished former governors, members of the supreme court, members of the cabinet, fellow Minnesotans...
Today we are at a crossroads. As I mentioned in my Inaugural address, there is a tremendous transition going on - in Washington, in Minnesota and in every state in the union. We are witnessing the most significant change of direction in national policy since President Franklin Delano Roosevelt created the New Deal.
In 60 years, we have gone from a nation with too little centralized power to a nation with way too much. And instead of making intelligent changes during the 1950s, 60s, 70s and 80s, we allowed more layers of government to be created. In the process we built up a wall between the citizen and his or her government. Today that wall is coming down.
The taxpayers will be heard and this legislative session is the taxpayers' session.
I want to make one thing absolutely crystal clear and that is that we, as a state, cannot choose to do nothing. That was made abundantly clear last week when a report entitled "Within Our Means" by Minnesota Planning documented that Minnesota has a structural budget gap - a gap that will add up to $25 billion by the year 2005. It is caused by changing demographics, which we cannot control, but also by our spending choices, which we can control. And rest assured, we will control spending.
Over the next ten years, we will experience major increases both in the number of school-age children and in the number of Minnesotans reaching retirement age; and together these factors will create an enormous bulge in government costs. Combine this with the expection that the number of working people - taxpayers - will level off, and we are left with a gaping hole between spending and tax revenues.

The report made it clear that if we continue to spend the way we spend today, Minnesota will be facing budget cut upon budget cut over the next 10 years. Something has to give, and in Minnesota, it will not be the taxpayer.
So the challenge of this transition is to learn to live within the new fiscal realities of our time - to do things differently. And within that context we must be very disciplined in identifying exactly what our priorities will be.
The people of Minnesota have made their priorities abundantly clear:
· They want a government that lives within its means and that means no general tax increases;
· They want an educational system that will allow their children to emerge as winners in the world economy. And they want communities and schools and streets that are free from violence.
· And they want a smarter, more efficient and more local government;
I want us to think anew about state government and push the highest degree of accountability down to the lowest level of governance.
On the national scene, we are seeing a shifting of power from the federal government to the states. Central to our budget proposal is an unprecedented plan to begin to shift the power of government back to the people. Let us launch an all-out war on expensive and ridiculous mandates be they from the federal government or from the state.
As governor, I can tell you how federal mandates have often taken common sense out of the work place.
For example, the federal government now requires that a full 10 percent of prison cells in each of our state prisons be wheelchair accessible. In Minnesota, 10 percent equals 400 cells. Yet here in Minnesota, we only have 20 inmates - yes 20 inmates - using wheelchairs, and 14 of them are in the geriatric prison in Faribault. So unless this mandate is lifted, we will be forced to spend millions and millions of taxpayer dollars to create accessible space for 400 disabled inmates that we don't have.
2

I'm for access and equality, but this is an absurdity. Once again, we see the great wall erected between the common sense of the people and the determined will of the political elite who always seem to know better.
At the state level, that wall will come down.
We will shift power away from the state bureaucracy back to the people. And we will do it by removing burdensome mandates and allowing communities to set their own priorities and make their own decisions through the use of flexible funding in the form of block grants.
Give people the tools and they will be far more creative and far more effective than any centralized government could ever be.
For example, in Rush City I visited a family center used by all of the families in the community - rich and poor, one-parent and two, struggling and successful. The center was built by the community, literally - they built the climbing equipment, and a local businessman generously donated the space. At this center kids can get their immunizations, parents can get support from other parents and families who are struggling can get the help they need. They did this with a block grant.
As more and more people get involved locally, they need and deserve more information about how their local tax dollars are spent. Minnesotans want us to provide meaningful information about how much each service costs and who is charging them for that service. And so we will introduce a substantial revision of "truth-in-taxation" so that every Minnesotan knows what they are getting and at what price.
State and local governments must also change. Today more than half of the state budget is returned to local governments. All of us can be more efficient. I support restructuring at the state level and our administration will drive those changes. But all management decisions must rest with the managers, not the legislature. And any changes we make must result in, one, cost savings for the taxpayer and, two, improved service to the taxpayer.
Let us not reorganize to make ourselves feel better - let's do it to give the people of Minnesota more value for their dollar.
3

And while the nation as a whole contemplates great change, I think it is only fitting that the Minnesota Legislature let the people participate in shaping the size and scope of their government. There is no better example of costly duplication in this state than the continuation of a burdensome two house system and it's ab~ut time we allowed the people to vote on a unicameral legislature.
And the people must be given the opportunity to vote on term limits. No legislative body has the right to maintain the big wall that protects them from the people.
I want to redefine the role of government to become a flexible agent of opportunity, not a road block to success.
There is no more tragic example of the misuse of mandates than the federal mandates on welfare.
Today we have a system that rewards teenagers for having children out of wedlock. We have a system that tells people the more children they have, and the less they work, the better off they will be. We give young parents a financial incentive for splitting up.
This is not a compassionate system, nor is it a helpful system. It is a social catastrophe. And we will not allow it to continue.
That is why I want Us to get very serious, very quickly, about welfare reform. And I hope
the federal government will have the wisdom to do the same by giving states the immediate flexibility we need to change.
Minnesotans want welfare reform. And when I say reform, ata minimum, I mean the following:
· First, any welfare reform proposal that I sign will eliminate, overnight, all welfare for able-bodied adults without kids. They should never have been on welfare in the first place.
· Second, I want to make sure that first time welfare applicants who have children have a very clear understanding of their obligation. And that obligation is to work. We will provide you with assistance in a variety of areas, but there will be no welfare check. We want people in need to succeed and the way to succeed is through employment.
Work is not punishment. Millions of Minnesotans go to work everyday in factories and offices and restaurants and warehouses - and they do it to pay their bills. Why should people on public assistance be taken off the hook?
· Third, I want us to expand a successful experiment we launched last year in seven counties called the Minnesota Family Investment Program. Participants in this program can work, yet still receive some assistance for a period of time. The program tries to serve as a sturdy, one-way bridge out of welfare, and preliminary numbers show that it is working.
· Fourth, we can require teenage parents to live with their own parents as a condition of receiving assistance. We want family members to come together in times of need.
· And finally, we can continue our growing commitment to child support enforcement. In fact, at the end of this month, we will be publishing in local newspapers the names of the 100 parents who owe the most in unpaid child support. It's sad that we must go to this extreme to hold some people responsible for the well-being of their own children.
These are the ingredients of a bill we will sign.' The people of Minnesota have said they want welfare reform. And they expect a proposal from the legislature that is not cluttered with controversial amendments. Every idea has the right to stand or fall on its own merit. And by the way, these are the legislature's rules.
I want us to give people a ticket out of welfare and instill the spirit of success in every child.
Our focus must be to make absolutely certain that every child has the opportunity to succeed and win in the world economy - first through a world-class education system and secondly, through the creation of good, high-paying jobs.


We owe it to our children to reorganize our services for children. Once and for all, we want a Department of Children and Education Services to serve the needs of young people from birth to career.. Working together, we can make this a reality.
We envision a department that focuses on nurturing and challenging every child to success.
We now have more than 250 different children's programs scattered throughout 15 different state agencies. Let's take all those resources and roll them into one state department - eliminating the duplication, fragmentation and turf battles.
Through the use of block grants, the new department will be a resource, not a regulator, in helping local schools and communities solve problems.
I see a department that will assist local communities in working to meet the challenging graduation standards that will be implemented next year. Minnesota employers expect our students to meet higher expectations than in the past and every single Minnesotan wants our children to meet those expectations. They can, they will.and they must.
We now know that within five years, 70 percent of the available jobs in America will not require a four-year degree, but they will require specific job training. That is why the new department will be involved in bringing employers to the center of education reform. Every teacher and every school should make it their business to learn the needs of Minnesota employers.
We will foster the creation of local partnerships between schools and employers and expand the youth apprenticeship concept throughout the state. We want to direct our resources toward those things that will give more kids the opportunity to graduate from high school with the hope of securing a decent job. This will be a difficult budget year, but youth apprenticeship· MUST be a priority.
In the area of higher education, every institution should see itself as an integral part of Minnesota's economic engine - preparing people for the world of work. H we truly care about our young people, we will measure the success of higher education by the number of graduates who are placed in good, high-wage jobs - and we will invest in those positive results.

And finally, let's not forget, when our children do begin to look for work, they need a reason to stay in Minnesota. Those jobs will not come here by accident. The fact is we have a solid economy with one of the lowest unemployment rates in America. And while the median income is dropping nationally, it is increasing in Minnesota. While poverty is increasing in America, it is dropping in Minnesota.
But we also know that we have a huge wall that is a barrier to future success. And that wall is created by an uncompetitive workers' compensation system and a continued expectation of tax increases.
Rest assured that wall will come down.
I want Minnesota to enact meaningful reform that addresses the major cost-drivers in the system. Let's vow not to lose one more employer to high workers' compensation costs.
And let's vow today that we will work to bring Minnesota out of the top ten states in taxes. That's why I am pledging no new general taxes through 1998.
If we can reform workers' compensation and lose our reputation as a high tax state, Minnesota has the potential to become an economic powerhouse in the 21st century. And we must settle for nothing less.
Underlying all of this is the reality that no state can succeed if it does not have an overall sense of security and optimism. And that cannot happen if people live in fear of violence. Minnesotans want to be able to walk the streets and feel safe, and they want to know that their family members are secure. We all share this goal, and we can achieve this goal together.
Let me share with you what the people of Brooklyn Park have done. For years, they watched as their community began to deteriorate, their crime rate marched upward and long time residents began to move out.
In the fall of 1993, they decided to act. Through an initiative called "Come Home to The Park" involving thousands of volunteers they have brought pride and growth back to their city. Apartment owners and property owners have cleaned up and fixed up their buildings. With the help of 160 new neighborhood watch programs and a very active business community, the serious crime rate dropped 20 percent last year.

Everyone feels good about Brooklyn Park again. Police Chief Don Davis, and former mayor, Jesse Ventura are here today and I salute you and all the people of your community. Rest assured, our Department of Public Safety will do everything it can to work with local police and strengthen our commitment to safe neighborhoods. People working together can make their neighborhoods, safe. Let us further understand that no matter how many programs we create, no matter how many prisons we build or how many police officers we put on the street, ultimately the strength of our communities rests in the values that bring us together. We in government have been reluctant to discuss values for fear of political labeling. But the truth is, this nation was formed by those who were committed to values. We want our children to grow up believing in honesty, hard work, discipline, mutual respect and a commitment to family and community. Each of us has an obligation to make certain that our children embody those values. Now the people have spoken. This is their hour. But you and I, as elected officials, should cast aside our political differences and work together on their will. For there is no more noble mission than one in which we walk hand-in-hand toward a future that once again ranks Minnesota as the finest place to live in the world.My fellow Minnesotans.
Much has been made about the selection of this location and this audience for the state of the state address. Some have questioned the decision to move the speech outside of the traditional Capitol chambers. Some have questioned the decision to speak to an unconventional audience, full of entrepreneurs and job creators from across Minnesota.
Well, I must admit: the critics are on to something. We picked this place and this audience precisely because our times demand that we break old conventions, alter old habits, and revise old ways of doing business.
We want change, reform, and growth for Minnesota, and I salute you for helping to lead the way. More broadly, it is Minnesotans themselves -- both in and out of this room -- who are demanding change, reform, and growth. It is now the task of those of us in government to respond and to deliver.
Join me, and together, we will.
We are trying something else new tonight. We are using technology -- video, computer graphics, photos, and other visual images -- to highlight this address. We do this not only to benefit the audience, but to illustrate our commitment to change, to emphasize the need to embrace the future, to think and act anew.
with that said, I suggest there is no better way to begin than to listen to what our fellow Minnesotans think of the state of the state, and to tell us, in their own words, how we can improve it.
As you can see, Minnesotans welcome change. In fact, they demand it. And they know what I know: that when Minnesotans unite, and work together towards a goal, there is little we cannot achieve.
I know this because five times I've come before the Legislature in a state of the state address and five times we have accomplished big things together. We have built a record of reform and results of which we can all be proud.
Take our biggest challenge, fiscal reform. When I first spoke to you as Governor, the state faced a $1.8 billion budget deficit. Our state spending was growing 15 percent faster than inflation and outpacing personal income. The state's bond rating had slipped and our financial house was in complete disarray.
Five years later, look what we have accomplished. We now have a $824 million surplus, not a deficit. We have stood firm against increases in taxes and have even cut some. Minnesota is now ranked among the top four states in financial management and we have reclaimed our AAA bond rating. Thanks to the Price of Government Resolution passed last year, we are actually on course to reduce the state's claim on personal income from 18.4 to 17.7 percent over the next five years.

The big spenders said it would never be done, but we held firm, and we all won.

Take health care reform. Three years ago, 95,000 Minnesotans

including 4,100 families could not afford private health

insurance. Today I thanks to MinnesotaCare I we are helping these

families get the quality care they need; care that keeps babies

and pregnant mothers healthy; care that keeps children well, in

school, and ready for success.


The critics said it could not be done, but we insisted it could, and we all won.

Take welfare reform. Just last spring, I signed a landmark bill that rewards work, helps families stay together, and eliminates welfare altogether for employable adults without children. Overnight, we have begun to transform the cycle of welfare dependency and despair into an action plan for work, opportunity, and hope. What is more, the twin reforms of health care and welfare are actually helping the'state to save money: some $200 million last year alone.

The status quo said it should not be done, but we demanded change, and we all won.

Take workers' compensation reform. The cost of Minnesota's workers' compensation system hit $1.2 billion in 1993, an all-time high. Prior to the reforms passed last year, Minnesota's rates averaged 25 percent more than neighboring states, driving businesses out of the state, despite a better safety record. Thanks to our joint efforts, the bill I signed cuts premiums up to 25 percent. It rewards employers for safe workplaces, reduces lawsuits, and helps those most in need.

The nay-sayers said it must not be done, but we did it, and we all won.

In the end, however, our success is not measured by the volume of our legislative work or by the number of decisions made at the state Capitol. What matters is that Minnesotans are enjoying wider economic and social success.

Personal income is up. From 1990 to 1994, income per person in Minnesota grew 18.5 percent, outpacing the national average. Our ranking among the states in personal income moved up from 19th to 16th.

Job creation is up. Minnesota grew 240,000 new non-agricultural jobs between 1991-95, a pace nearly twice the national average. Unemployment is down. Minnesota's jobless rate in November was just 2.8 percent, less than half the national average.

Our economy is the strongest in the Midwest. In a state-by-state comparison, the Corporation for Enterprise Development ranked Minnesota as having the nation's fifth best job market and the region's best overall economic performance. They also ranked us as enjoying the highest quality of life. Minnesotans worked hard to build this record of success and we are not going to let the spenders, the nay-sayers, or the critics take it away.

These are not just statistics, positive as they are. The real story is that broad economic success allows Minnesotans to pursue their dreams, from owning a home to buying a business. It allows them to provide for their families, to save for their children's education, to plan for their retirement. It means more than money, more than material. It means lives less burdened by worry, lives more full, lives more free.

Despite these successes, problems remain: problems that are testing our faith in the American dream, in our hopes for a better community, state, and nation. Left ignored, they threaten to undue all we have accomplished together.
First, too many of our schools --- especially in Minneapolis and St. Paul --- are failing, and large numbers of our children are failing, too. Over six years, we have increased spending on education 57 percent --- almost ten percent per year --- and yet scores for most students in our core cities are declining.
Consider Minneapolis. According to tests reported by the Minneapolis school district, the percentage of fifth graders who passed basic math dropped 14 points in just five years. The percentage dropped 11 points on the basic writing test and 10 points for reading. These are the results despite the fact that per pupil funding in Minneapolis has risen to $9,200, almost 50 percent more than the average school district.
Consider St. Paul. The four year drop out rate for grades 9-12 is more than 50 percent, according to St. Paul's own statistics. For native American children, the rate climbs to 78 percent, for African Americans it hits 67 percent, for Hispanics, 65 percent. My friends, this is nothing short of wholesale crisis.
Minnesota simply cannot compete and win in the global economy if we accept such widespread failure as "good enough." Nor can Minnesota afford the social costs of more street crime, massive expansions in our welfare rolls, and more stress on our already over-burdened justice system.
We cannot afford dawdling and delay, we must move to reform education now. Join me, and together, we will.
Second, despite tougher sentences, crime is up, and people feel less safe. Last year, we saw an unprecedented explosion of violence in Minneapolis. A city once known nationally for its exceptional quality of life and as a vibrant business and cultural center now generates stories about its soaring murder rate --- 97 last year.
Violence has also become more random. Innocents and bystanders are being killed, creating tragedy for their families and raising fears for all.
The costs of responding to this social breakdown are also spiraling out of control. Violent crime among juveniles has climbed 260 percent, thereby driving up incarceration rates. If we continue at this pace, Minnesota will be forced to build a prison every two years, at a cost of $100 million each.
We must change this course. Join me, and together, we will.
Third, Minnesotans feel anxious about job security, and sense that their quality of life is threatened. Major corporations are downsizing, laying off hundreds, sometimes thousands of employees. High-pay, high-benefit middle management jobs are being slated for extinction, as companies rush to stay competitive in the global marketplace.
Many middle class families are finding it difficult to get ahead, with the big bite of taxes and the press of monthly bills. Even many double-income households are one paycheck away from debt, one downturn away from the unemployment line.
These are the realities and complexities of life in the middle 1990s. Times have changed, and we must change with them. Join, me, and together we will.
The old ways will not work. We cannot tax are way out of these problems; more taxes will only reduce, not increase, our social


and economic well-being. We cannot spend our way out of these problems. The state and local governments already face future budget shortfalls of $8 billion by 2001. We cannot look to Washington, D.C., for salvation Ñ thanks to reformers there, the federal government is finally attempting to live within its means. But that means less for Minnesota.
One thing is clear: past approaches are outdated, ineffective, or unaffordable. We need bold approaches, fresh thinking, and new ways of doing business.
The comprehensive report, prepared at my request by former Congressman Vin Weber and former state Senator John Brandl recommending ways to solve our upcoming budget gaps, highlights this fresh thinking. I urge the state Legislature and all Minnesotans to give their proposals serious consideration, because this Administration certainly will.
But I also want to offer my strategy for managing the new realities, my plan for meeting Minnesota's challenges.
Three years remain in my term and what I outline now is my three year plan. Before I get to other specifics, however', I suggest we focus first on rebuilding our confidence in lawmakers and democratic institutions. That confidence has been shaken lately by Phonegate, by criminal probes of legislators, by headline stories of unethical conduct.
Let us face it: public officials have a credibility gap. To be credible reformers, we must first fix our own system. For too long, it has been too open to abuse of power, too prone to excessive influence by special interests, too removed from the will and aspirations of the people.
I propose comprehensive legislative reform. I do not refer to tweaking around the edges. I mean full scale change that lets the public know we mean business.
This session, I will offer a package that will restrict per diem only to days the Legislature is actually in session. Taxpayers should not be asked to pick up the tab unless the people's business is being done.
We must end certain conflicts of interest, like requiring a member to excuse himself or herself from voting on matters relating directly to their occupation. We must require the state auditor to audit the Legislature. In the past, the Legislature has tried to audit itself, an arrangement that lacked proper distance and oversight.
We must apply all laws to the Legislature itself. Inexcusably, the Legislature has excused itself from affirmative action and pay-equity laws, strict civil service code and collective bargaining agreements, and a variety of other special arrangements.
The Legislature should live by a simple rule: if a law is good enough for the people of Minnesota, it is good enough for legislators.
We must create a unicameral Legislature. Minnesota has the fifth largest Legislature in the nation and the cost of maintaining it is enormous. In 1972, it cost $8.5 million. In 1992, it cost $77 million. Let us pass a constitutional amendment for a one-house legislature.
We must provide for initiative and referendum. The state Capitol is not the repository for all wisdom. Let us give the people the chance to express their will on the ballot.
And I want term limits. Term limits will inject new blood, new vitality into a system too often controlled by the vested, and the entrenched. No politician is so valuable he can't be furloughed.
These reforms will restore trust and confidence in our system. Before I leave office, I will insist that comprehensive legislative reform becomes law.
One area where we have already built public trust is in fiscal management. We have done so because we held firm to our conviction that good financial planning -- living within our means -- is a necessary first step to good government. Our efforts have paid off with a $824 million surplus.
I know there will be a rush to spend this money a hundred different ways. Some legislators remind me of a teenager with a new credit card: they never met a spending limit they could not exceed.
But I tell you: this is not the politician's money, it is the taxpayer's money. Minnesotans worked hard to provide it. And as long as I am Governor, we will respect their labors and we will not squander their hard-won surplus.
We will not propose dramatic new spending, but we will request targeted investments, targeted tax relief, and wise planning for the future.
Out of the $824 million, some $200 million comes about due to savings as a result of health and welfare reform, we will spend just $160 million on our top priorities. Those priorities include crime enforcement and prevention, youth jobs and intervention, and education technology and reform.
We will target $24 million to tax relief, $100 million over four years. These tax cuts will help retain and create jobs in Minnesota and will help parents provide advanced education for their children.
All the rest --- nearly two-thirds of a billion dollars --- we will save.
The first $140 million will go to the budget reserve we created last year to help us prepare for federal cutbacks, an economic downturn, and future shortfalls. The balance --- some $500 million --- will be saved.
But make no mistake: we will not surrender it up to the spenders. During my time in office, I have built something of a reputation for using the veto pen. If the spenders in the Legislature attempt to fritter away this surplus, I am going to relish the chance of adding to that reputation.
Within this framework, then, we will make targeted investments. The first must be to protect public safety because that is the first role of government. Nothing else can succeed --- not job growth, not social bonds --- unless we first are physically secure.
By public safety I do not mean safe only in certain areas, only at certain times, only if you are a certain sex, and only if you are a certain color.
I mean safe anytime, anywhere, no matter who you are, allover Minnesota.
We offer a two-track approach. The first is improved enforcement. Minnesota already has enough laws, tough sentences, and strong penalties in place. Our task now is to confront the gangs, the thugs, and the criminals directly on the streets.
Police Chief Wade Setter in Brooklyn Park provides a model for what works. This 17-year veteran supervises a force of 68 officers who patrol the streets and neighborhoods of that city. In the past five years, homicide, assault, burglary, larceny, and auto theft have all declined, thanks to neighborhood watch groups, citizen involvement, and community policing they helped organize.

I propose the "Safe Streets Initiative" to build on this success. Through this program, we will hire police on overtime to conduct neighborhood sweeps. During these sweeps, officers will strictly enforce all laws, including curfew, truancy, and traffic laws. police will develop street contacts, check for outstanding warrants, and generate intelligence on suspected criminals. The objective is simple: arrest all violators.

The sweeps will also be conducted across jurisdictions, using many law enforcement agencies. For example, the Hennepin and Ramsey County Sheriff's Departments will work with Minneapolis and St. Paul. Bloomington will work with Brooklyn Park, and Burnsville will work with Maplewood.

To the thugs who would prey on our citizens we say this: get out of Minnesota now, or you will pay the price. Stay, and you will do time.

We will build the effectiveness of law enforcement agencies by upgrading their communications systems. We will also insist on building up a full staff complement for the State Patrol. I will ask for 46 additional troopers to keep our motorists safe.

We will do more to strengthen community policing, to help citizens form block clubs and crime watch groups, and to build closer ties between law enforcement and the people they protect.

Through partnerships and teamwork, we can and we will take back our streets, our schools, our homes, and our neighborhoods.

Crime control also requires prevention. We must do more to give
our youth positive alternatives to life on the streets. We can start by investing directly in community programs that work, rather than in more government bureaucracies that don't. We want
to empower existing community organizations like YMCA's, neighborhood recreation centers, and church groups that reach out to at~risk juveniles.

A good example is the St. Paul Children's Youth Initiative,

supervised by Kathleen Vellenga. They run a program called the

Dad's Group, which helps men become more effective, more

responsive fathers. Given the high rates of teenage pregnancy

and single-parent families in the inner city, nothing could be

more important than strengthening fatherhood.


I also believe that the best anti-crime remedy ever invented is

something called a job. Work not only pays the bills. It builds

self-respect. It fosters personal responsibility. It strengthens

community.



That is why I propose to provide $6 million for summer jobs that will reach 5,000 at-risk youth. The need for this program is especially acute now, given federal cutbacks in this area. Let us agree to give these children a shot at success by giving them a shot at a job.

I also want schools to become full partners in crime prevention.
That is why I will call for $20 million to finance new construction or remodeling of schools and community centers that offer after-school enrichment programs. I will also propose $5 million in grants to three neighborhoods in St. Paul, and three in Minneapolis, that establish after-school enrichment programs. We will target those areas with especially high rates of poverty, teen pregnancy, and juvenile crime.

Some may not like these investments. But consider the alternative. In addition to social costs, criminal justice is the fastest growing part of the budget, up 25 percent in just two years. Left unchecked, these trends will soon crowd out spending in areas like education and health care. We must move now to change our course.

From the beginning, we have been committed to strengthening the twin pillars of job growth and quality of life because they define who we are as people, and as a state. In a competitive global economy, we dare not take them for granted. We must pursue an aggressive strategy that improves both.

I offer two examples from our bonding bill which illustrate what I mean by a commitment to quality of life. The first is our request to fund a new $34 million Science Museum of Minnesota on the riverfront in St. Paul.

The Science Museum is nothing short of a state-wide treasure. Its exhibits, displays, and films help minds, young and old, to understand and appreciate their world. And as a hub for St. Paul's riverfront redevelopment project, a new science museum
will do more than inform and enrich. It will serve as a draw for the entire area, bringing world-wide tourists and economic vitality with it. The Science Museum models how interdependent quality of life and economic success are.

We will also invest in Minnesota's natural resources and our citizen's love of the outdoors. Our entire environmental package will top $65 million next year, $174 million over six years. But one program exemplifies our commitment.

The Reinvest in Minnesota program --- RIM is now ten years old and yet has never been fully funded. RIM helps retire marginal land for the benefit of water, soil, fish, and wildlife. Fully 1.4 million Minnesotans bought hunting or fishing licenses last year, pouring $1.5 billion into our economy to pursue their pastimes. They, and we, want to conserve our natural resources for our children and grandchildren. That is why I am proud to fund RIM at $12 million on its 10th Anniversary and I ask the Legislature to approve it.

We also must have a strategic approach to job creation. We propose to advance the sales tax exemption on capital equipment, bringing the rate down to zero by January, 1998. We do this because equipment-intensive sectors, including forest products, printing, and value-added agriculture are among the biggest, and most productive, in Minnesota. Cutting this tax means jobs, pure and simple.

We also propose targeted tax relief to entrepreneurs who invest in our core cities, bringing employment and opportunity with them. We want areas that had been red lined by businesses to become red hot with the energy and vitality of new jobs.

We will push for development of new products in agriculture and related industries, which provide one in nearly four jobs in Minnesota. We are especially excited by the possibilities of value-added products, which are turning soybeans into building materials; corn into fuel; and in the future, alfalfa into electricity.

But perhaps our most exciting proposal is in the field of medical
technology, a $2 billion industry in this state. Minnesota is home to 500 medical product companies employing 16,000 people, ranking us second in the nation. Our medical expertise at the University of Minnesota and the Mayo clinic has built a national and international reputation.

The best is exemplified by Dr. Frank Cerra, Dean of the Medical School, and Dr. Wei-Shou, inventors of an artificial liver. The product they developed is called the Regenerex machine, which will help support the livers of patients until they can receive a



liver transplant. They now need funding in order to seek FDA approval.
There are other obstacles. For example, researchers at the University are working on 21st century problems in labs developed 50 years ago, using equipment that in some cases dates back 20 years. Unless we act now, Minnesota could lose hundreds, even thousands of jobs to high-tech states like California·.
Our plan is to make the University of Minnesota a medical technology resource center second to none and to create a seamless "medical alley" to Rochester Mayo. That is why I am asking for $6.5 million to upgrade the university's medical research facilities. We have an urgent need for more lab space with the latest equipment.
We want to make sure that when bright ideas are developed, they get turned into marketable products. This is called "technology transfer," a service provided by a state funded organization known as Minnesota Technology. Minnesota Technology does a good job; we want them to do even better, which is why they are working closely with our Department of Trade and Economic Development to make sure that Minnesota's brightest minds get connected to Minnesota's best entrepreneurs.
That's how Minnesota gave birth to Medtronic, which now employs 5,000 in Minnesota and generates $2 billion in business a year. Win Wallen, the company's Chairman of the Board, put it succinctly: "without the University of Minnesota, Medtronic never would have located here." We want the Medtronics of the future to say the same thing: we will grow in Minnesota.
We cannot prevent or reduce crime, grow jobs, or create long-term economic and social opportunity unless we first reform our education system. To do that, we must be honest about its problems.
Before I address those, let me first say that I know many parents strongly support their public schools and are pleased with the quality of their children's education. They are right to be proud. Public schools in Edina, Fergus Falls, Willmar, Burnsville, Kenyon-Wanamingo and hundreds of other communities in Minnesota work and work well. I salute the parents, teachers, administrators and school boards in them all.
But those successes cannot blind us to our failures. While it is true our college bound students are doing pretty well, our non-college bound students are falling further behind. For example, just 10 of 53 elementary schools in Minneapolis scored at or above the national average on the California Achievement Test.
Employers are the first to pick up on this low achievement. A majority of employers in Minneapolis and St. Paul report that over half of today's job applicants lack basic skills in math, reading and writing.
Those who embrace the status quo are quick to quibble over statistics. But I ask you: how many ways must we count failure --- how many more children must we lose --- before we admit the problem and begin providing solutions?
I say this: the time for delay is over. The time for leadership is now and I intend to provide it.
We have a mUlti-front strategy aimed at freeing up teachers, schools, parents, and children and giving them the tools they need to succeed.
First, we want to give teachers more freedom: freedom to receive rewards for outstanding work in the classroom in the form of merit pay. Teaching is a noble profession. Few roles in society are more important than that of educator and mentor. We entrust our very future to those who would excite and expand young minds.
Merit pay rewards excellence. Merit pay spurs performance. We want our good teachers to be well compensated and for school districts to have incentives to recruit and retain them. We will seek merit pay for teachers.
We want to loosen teacher tenure. Too often, tenure locks in mediocrity and locks out our finest young teachers. Is it not an injustice against children when three Teachers of the Year in the past 15 years are not rehired because of tenure? We must put a premium on excellence, not seniority. We will seek changes in tenure.
We also want binding arbitration. We support the right of teachers to bargain collectively. But when both sides negotiate in good faith, should we not resolve the dispute through an honest broker, a neutral third party? Must we hold six, seven, and eight year-old children hostage to a labor dispute? We will seek binding arbitration.
I spoke of freeing up teachers. We also must free up schools. We will say to schools: tell us the mandates that are blocking your path to excellence and we will remove them. We are not in the procedure business. We are not in the inputs business. We are in the results business. If a mandate is an obstacle to achievement, we will not balk. It will be waived.
We will also invest in technology. I propose $22 million for hardware, software, and communications technology for Minnesota's public schools. Some of that money will expand fiber optic lines, some will purchase computers, some will buy programming. We want a student in Blackduck to learn French via the Internet while the student in Eagan writes a term paper using the Library of Congress. We want to equip our children with the computer literacy skills they will need to excel in the workplace of the future.
We will also get business involved. We will expand our program to refurbish computers donated by the private sector, a program which also builds partnerships and relationships schools need to succeed. Our goal is to put Minnesota schools in the top five in technology.
Most importantly, we must free up parents. The best school districts already are responsive to parents, already seek out and value their views. But we must do more to empower parents, to put them in charge of their children's educational destiny.
One way is to offer parents an education IRA, a program we call Edvest. We propose to allow parents to create a special tax free savings account for higher education and to exempt the."first $4000 they deposit into it each year. The private sector and non-profit organizations will also be encouraged to donate matching funds.
My friends, this is a tax cut for families working to educate their children and I say it's about time.
This program embodies our belief that, given the proper tools, parents will invest in their children's future. We trust parents more than institutions to make the best decisions on behalf of their children and to take responsibility for the results.
This is why we embrace parental choice. We want to give children from moderate and low-income families the same opportunities the affluent already enjoy. Our plan builds on open enrollment, which Minnesota passed in 1987 amid many of the same objections we are hearing now. We want to expand the range of choices to include private and parochial schools. Our choice pilot program includes Minneapolis, St. Paul, Brooklyn Center and one outstate school district.
with choice, we not only get more freedom, we get more competition. And we want to promote competition between schools. The truth is that competition spurs excellence. Competition keeps the focus on outcomes. Just as Detroit auto companies were forced to innovate, change, and improve thanks to foreign competition in the 1970s and 1980s, schools will improve thanks to school choice.
Let us not allow a whole generation of Minnesota children to slip away. Let us not allow the forces of inertia and the status quo to keep us from doing what is right.
I pledge today: Minnesota parents will have school choice.
with the 1996 legislative session now underway, I hear many things. Some say we should do little this year and next. Maybe just fine tune the budget, embrace the status quo, coast, simply manage the ride. But that is not why we are here. And that defensive posture escalates the social price.
It means even lower public trust in democratic institutions. It means chronic budget cuts or chronic tax increases. It means accepting failure in many inner city public schools. It means escalating crime rates and violence. It means a new 600-bed prison every two years. It means losing ground to global competition, the steady erosion of high-paying jobs and Minnesota's quality of life.
My friends, it is irresistible: Change will overwhelm the status quo. The only question is whether we make change our enemy or our ally.
Simply put, we have an exciting journey ahead. It represents an opportunity for all of us to more closely define and protect the one ingredient that brings us all together and that is our love for the quality of life in Minnesota. The fact is, whether you live in Warroad or Caledonia or Worthington or Duluth, we like life in Minnesota. We expect government to prevent harm and to enhance success.
Tonight I outlined in the State of the State new job creation opportunities that will allow us to continue to out-pace national growth, new partnerships that link our great Universities with the Mayo Clinic and the private sector, unprecedented access to computers for all of our children, and a prevention program that is second to none. These are not concerns that are either Republican or Democrat and they cannot be defined or measured according to the normal political slide rule. The fact is, we recognize change and we want to harness that change for the betterment of all people.
I want all of us to cast aside that which divides and begin moving in the direction that defines a better Minnesota, a safer Minnesota, a more opportunistic Minnesota and a winning Minnesota.
The truth is my friends, this is a marvelous state and you and I are going to work together to make it even better. We want to make absolutely certain that we give to our children no less than what our parents gave to us. And we want their children to have the same shot at happiness and success.
We remain committed to that agenda, to that goal, to that dream.Thank you. Speaker Carruthers, President Spear, fellow constitutional officers, members of the Supreme Court and Court of Appeals, former Governors, members ofthe Minnesota Legislature, friends and Minnesotans.
It is with great pleasure that Lt. Governor Joanne Benson and I come to share with you, the people of Minnesota, our optimism for Minnesota's future. Today, I will share my goals for this upcoming session, my thoughts on the last six years and my vision for where we are headed.
As you know, this will be my last major State of the State address. I want you to know what a pleasure it has been to work with this distinguished body over the past six years and what an honor and privilege it is to serve as Governor of this wonderful state. I want to thank the many people in this room and throughout Minnesota who have worked with me.
It has been my pleasure to work with the legislative leaders of both parties: Senate Majority Leader Roger Moe; Senate Minority Leader Dean Johnson; House Minority Leader Steve Sviggum and former House Speaker Irv Anderson. And I look forward to a good working relationship with our new House Speaker, Phil Carruthers. Congratulations on your election, Speaker Carruthers.
I must admit, it has not always been easy being a governor from one party and working with a Legislature of the other party. Often we have been at odds over issues. Yet, in the end, we have formed coalitions and alliances and set aside partisan politics for the well-being of the state.
One thing I have discovered as Governor, is the incredible spirit of community in our state. I have seen it in the willingness of Minnesotans to roll up our sleeves and work together to preserve and enhance the future of our children, the beauty of our surroundings, and the economic vitality of our cities, neighborhoods, towns and countryside.
And, when confronted with a crisis, we go out of our way to help. Whether it is our farmers during the crisis of the 1980s, the floods of the 1990s, or the blizzards of this winter, Minnesota does pull together.
And by working together, I would argue that we in Minnesota have accomplished more significant reform over the last six years than any state in America.


Financial management

At my first State of the State Address, I spoke about how Minnesota was in financial crisis. State spending exceeded revenue by $800,000 per day. Our budget was $1.8 billion in the red. Clearly, our financial house was not in order.

Since those early days, our administration has focused on long-term financial planning:

· We wanted adequate budget savings in case of a recession.

· We wanted to keep government spending below the rise in personal income.

· We wanted to avoid spending commitments that could not be kept.

· Controlling the growth in state spending led to 181 vetoes which prevented more than $1.5 billion in new taxes, spending, and fees. I want to again thank the minority leaders who helped sustain these vetoes -- Steve Sviggum, Dean Johnson, and former minority leader Terry Dempsey who is with us today.

Without these vetoes, today we would not be discussing a $1.4 billion surplus.

Today:

· We have instilled a culture of responsible spending.

· We have regained our AAA bond rating from two of three credit agencies.

· Minnesota is ranked among the top five states in financial management and I say one of the two best in America.

· We have cut taxes by $356 million. And I am proud to say that we will be proposing a tax cut that will return $500 million to Minnesota taxpayers.

On top of that good news, for the first time in decades, our budget will have a long-term structural balance through the year 2002. And we met this week with Standard & Poors about restoring the final AAA bond rating.

Health Care/Welfare

In 1992, this Legislature, working on a bipartisan basis, adopted a comprehensive strategy to improve health care for all Minnesotans. This package of reforms, now called MinnesotaCare, is a national model for health care reform.

· Today, 95,000 low- and moderate-income Minnesotans who previously had no health insurance now have coverage under MinnesotaCare.

· 35,000 families and 52,000 children now have coverage. The percentage of uninsured Minnesota children has been slashed by 43 percent.

· With our expansion of the MinnesotaCare program last year, an additional 45,000 individuals will be covered by 1999.

In combination with our successful welfare reform plan, we have given families enough help to make the jump from welfare to work. This means many more children are being raised in families where work is a way of life.
· Today, 4,000 fewer Minnesota families are relying on w~lfare benefits.

· We have cut state spending for welfare by more than 21 percent.

· Together, reforms in health care and welfare have saved our taxpayers more than $200 million.

· The foundation of our welfare reform philosophy is work. And the key to putting people to work is creating jobs.

Look at the jobs area:

· We have created 313,000 new jobs.

· With an unemployment rate at nearly half the national average, we are creating jobs 65 percent faster than the rest of the nation.

· And while manufacturing job growth has declined nationally, Minnesota is seeing modest growth, especially in Central Minnesota.

Our business climate today is more conducive to expansion and growth thanks to comprehensive workers' compensation reform.

· We have saved Minnesota employers $121 million, an overall 35 percent cut in premiums.

· Our system encourages workers to return to their jobs and discourages litigation.

Environment

As Minnesotans, we treasure and enjoy our environment like no other state in America. Where else but

Minnesota can you enjoy the breathtaking beauty and year-round recreation offered by our lakes, rivers, parks and trails.

And as an administration, our commitment to the environment includes:

· Adoption of the nation's toughest wetlands law which protects this vital resource and provides local governments the authority to develop their own management plans.

· An unprecedented commitment to clean up the Minnesota River so it can once again be a recreational resource for our families.

· A sustainable development initiative that serves as a national model for how to merge the needs of business with the demands of our environment.

· And a partnership with business that produces better environmental results. Because the best way to get results is to work together.

Children's Issues

Finally, in the area of improving the well-being of children, Minnesota's accomplishments rank second to none. From the beginning, children have been a top priority of this administration. Our commitment has been emphasized with funding increases for children's programs that surpass any time in Minnesota history.

Over the past six years:

· We have taken bold steps to streamline services for children and families starting with the creation of the Department of Children, Families and Learning.

· Today there is a single children's agenda for the state of Minnesota -- something that has never existed before -- integrating all educational and social programs for kids and families.

· We have created incentives for communities to work together for the well-being of children.

· Today, 57 family service collaboratives bring community schools, community organizations and health professionals and social service workers together to share resources and ideas.

· And the results are impressive. In Blue Earth County alone we have seen a $296,000 savings in out-of-home placements and an increase in parent involvement in schools. Not only does this save money, but more importantly, it saves children.
In all of these areas, I can confidently report that we in Minnesota have accomplished more reform in the last six years than in any other state in America. Now, we must turn our attention to the challenges that lie ahead.


This afternoon, I would like to talk about community -- our community. As a whole, Minnesota is one community. We are proud of this community -- it gives us identity and defines our heritage. No matter where we live -- whether in Warroad or Worthington, Moorhead or Minneapolis, Togo or Tonka Bay-we are still one community.
As legislators, you bear the title of state senator or state representative. Your job is to balance the needs of your local districts with the needs of the state community as a whole. And, I know how difficult that can be at times.
On the opening day of this legislative session, I was struck by the words of Senator Roger Moe. "We are one state, we are one family," he said. He reminded us that we have a tendency to divide ourselves -- to pit rural Minnesota against the metro area, north against south, cities against suburbs.
Senator Moe, I want you to know, I fully agree with you. And as we look toward the future, I pray that we will continue to work as one community.
And two areas where I hope we can agree are the need for property tax reform and pay raises for our state agency commissioners.
· Yes, I believe that commercial/industrial property taxes are too high -- number one in several categories. We must be honest if we plan on addressing property tax reform. High taxes affect our ability to grow jobs.
· That is why I have asked Revenue Commissioner Jim Girard to work with a bipartisan legislative group to address real property tax reform. We want to grow jobs in Minnesota.
· And it's time that the commissioners of our state agencies receive a pay increase. These people have not had a pay raise in more than 10 years. So I am asking you to pass a bill allowing pay raises for the commissioners, and I support increasing the pay of legislators and the judiciary, too.
Crime/Corrections
But let me be clear on community. A strong community cannot succeed if it cannot protect its own. The good news today is that Minnesotans feel safer in their community than they did three years ago. And overall crime rates have declined across America and in Minnesota.
Since 1991, my administration has made fighting crime a top priority. We have:
· Increased funding for courts and judges.
· Introduced strategies such as police street sweeps and community policing.
· Strengthened penalties for drive-by shootings, sex crimes and stalking.
· And made Minnesota among the toughest states in America for violent repeat offenders and crimes committed with a gun.
Crime statistics show that these efforts have made a difference. However, as overall crime has decreased, the number of violent juvenile offenders has increased dramatically. And certain inner city areas of Minnesota are literally under siege.
Statistics show that most juvenile offenders begin with small infractions and progress to more serious crimes, often because they suffer no consequences. To reverse this trend, we must target the first-time offender and send a message that no misbehavior will be tolerated. Let me make this clear -- the first-time offender cannot become a second-time offender.
· Through a partnership with the Minnesota National Guard, we will establish work camps at Camp Ripley where first-time juvenile offenders will clear brush, maintain roads and clean up facilities. I want kids working hard and learning to do something constructive as a team.
· Repeat or violent juvenile offenders will undergo more intense supervision and job training to give them the skills to succeed when they return home.
· The focus is on discipline.
Our crime plan also cracks down on high crime neighborhoods and gangs who prey on our community by peddling drugs and violence to our children. We will increase the visibility and presence of police through street sweeps and strict enforcement of all laws.
The success of this aggressive strategy, called Broken Windows, can be seen in New York City. In the last three years, this crime fighting strategy has led to a 39 percent drop in major crime. And the murder rate is at its lowest since 1968. I want the same dramatic results we have seen in New York City to be the reality here.
To keep kids from entering a life of crime, we will expand our aggressive prevention agenda by investing in effective, community-oriented programs which give our young people an alternative to life on the streets. We will target neighborhoods with especially high rates of poverty, teen pregnancy and juvenile crime. We want to keep our young people out of trouble.


We will also increase our focus on children and families with more targeted investments in programs which make a difference in the lives of our working families.
· We will increase funding for programs that help children even before they start school through programs such as Head Start, Early Childhood Family Education and Learning Readiness.
· We are proposing the biggest increase in child care dollars in state history to help welfare families move off government dependence and into the workforce.
· And we will increase support for families who work, particularly those families who are teetering on the edge of self-sufficiency but need a helping hand to pull it all together.
Welfare
Through our ground breaking welfare reform plan and increased aid to working families, we want to break the cycle of poverty. Children deserve the chance to grow up in families where there is work, structure and hope.
· With new strict time limits and work requirements, we will continue to target those individuals who lack the necessary job experience or education that can make them self-sufficient. We will help them become more self-sufficient.

Our administration is committed to working with businesses, big and small, to help provide these individuals withjobs. However, government's responsibility should not be to create jobs. Rather, government must create a climate in which grows quality jobs and produces skilled workers.
Therefore, I urge our businesses who have a shortage of workers to hire these individuals and give them a shot at independence. Both the individual and community will benefit. We will work with you to make this a reality.
Our goal is to make our communities safe and all of our people productive and contributing members.


But a community must also have soul. Our culture, our essence is captured by the arts.
· Our state's 30,000 artists and 1,700 arts organizations generate more than $1 billion each year for our economy.
· We have an active and growing film industry. Film and video production is now a $250 million per year industry that employs over 5,000 people.
But the arts are far more than dollars. The arts give our communities their identity. That is why I am proposing an arts initiative to help nonprofit arts organizations increase their touring activity in Greater Minnesota. Through increased funding we will help communities to create their own arts festivals--to celebrate, to honor creativity and to strengthen their identity.
I want all Minnesotans, no matter where they live, to be able to experience the arts and how they can enhance our communities and unite people from all walks of life. I can see community arts festivals, community theaters springing up -- let the sounds of music vibrate throughout Minnesota. I want Salsburg to talk about the Minnesota music festival.
Stadium
Like the arts, sports give us a strong community identity -- from our youngsters who play T-ball at the neighborhood park, to high school athletics, to our state's professional teams the Vikings, Twins, and Timberwolves. Truly, sports are a part of Minnesota's community.
So are the Minnesota Twins. On this issue, I urge you to look at outcomes. If we do not support the stadium, we will lose the Twins. I do not want our families to lose the opportunity to take their kids to a Twins game.
Yet, critics, say that we should not publicly support a private enterprise whatever the consequence. But, I remind you, community subsidies are part of our public policy. Through tax increment financing, through revenue bonds, and through direct government subsidies and grants.
Take for instance the budget our administration will be releasing next week. It includes $100 million in school aid reimbursements for tax increment financing. Communities throughout the state have committed public resources to help private businesses.
The state has aided other private ventures, too. For example:
· Northwest Airlines. If the state had not stepped in and provided Northwest a loan to keep their operations running, we would now be lamenting the loss of 20,000 direct jobs. An additional 110,000 jobs supported by the airport and $5.5 billion into our economy would have been severely cut back. And many other small and large companies would have looked elsewhere for a more convenient location. Not to mention that the state's pension fund benefitted from the Northwest deal.


We have also supported:
· A new potato plant in Park Rapids.
· A manufacturing company in Benson.
· An ice rink in Roseville.
· An exposition center in Worthington.
· Direct subsidies to political campaigns.
· And by the year 2000, we will have provided nearly $100 million to our state's ethanol industry.
If we as a community are to continue our successes of the past, we must ignore the critics and work together to forge solutions to the challenges we face.
This proposition goes beyond subsidy. For a ten cent tax on cigarettes, we can own 49 percent of the Twins as well as a $350 million outdoor stadium. That is a good investment.
Let me tell you today, I want the Twins to stay in Minnesota. And I will do what I can to bring hockey to St. Paul. Both are part of our communities' quality of life.

A sound community also prepares its young for responsible jobs and toward that end we can all agree on the importance of our higher education system in preparing our students for the challenge of the work place. When it comes to competing for jobs, our state has prospered, largely because of the quality of our workforce.
However, to ensure that our economy continues growth in dynamic, cutting-edge industries, we must form a closer partnership with our entire higher education system:
· It is crucial that we continue to support and strengthen our state colleges and our community and technical colleges in their effort to educate and train Minnesotans for jobs of the future. We to want work closely with Judith Eaton and the presidents of campuses in Bemidji, Mankato, Moorhead, Willmar, Winona, St. Cloud and Southwest State to make our system one of the best in the nation. For instance, students at Northland Technical College in Thief River Falls now each have their own laptop computer thanks to IBM.
· We must provide the University of Minnesota, the state's only research university, with the resources to foster new technologies that can drive our state's economic engine.
· I applaud the University's selection of Mark Yudof and am excited about a close working relationship to help him achieve his goal of making the University of Minnesota a leader in digital technology and one of the top five public institutions in America.
· I am confident that President Yudof will bring a new sense of excitement to the University and will sell that mission and sense of community statewide..
And we will continue our technology transfer initiative to develop more cutting-edge devices with our expertise at the University of Minnesota. By partnering with Academic Health Sciences we can bring ideas from the laboratory to the marketplace. Minnesota has over 500 medical product companies employing 15,000 people, ranking us second in the nation.


Our high school graduates must be prepared to work in a high tech economy.

But the red flags are waving. In a recent study, 42 percent of our employers report that our high school graduates lack necessary skills in reading, writing and math. And with one ofthe nation's tightest labor markets, demand for skilled workers will only increase.

· By the year 2000, 70 percent of all jobs will no longer require a college degree. But, they will require workers to have basic reading and math skills.

· However, our standardized tests tell us that one-third of eighth graders failed basic math and one-fourth failed basic reading.

· And 50 percent of the students in Minneapolis and 8t. Paul drop out.

Well let me tell you, my friends -- no successful community allows its children to fail.

And what is the price of this failure? From funding faulty outcomes through remedial education to the growing cost of our corrections system and welfare rolls, we spend upwards of $2 billion annually on the cost of failure. And this cost will only increase unless we focus on those children who are not making it.

We must do better. Last month I announced a package of reform to make schools accountable to students and families. We want to:

· Establish a statewide test to measure the performance of our students and our schools.

· Drive decision-making to the local level and allow school boards to enter innovative performance contracts to better student achievement.

· Develop charter schools free from government restrictions so they can use creative strategies to tickle the minds of our children.

· Partner with our state universities to put laboratory schools on campuses across Minnesota.

· Establish tax-free savings accounts for families who invest in their children's futures.

· Provide tax credits and deductions to expand choices for parents and students. The money can be used to:

1. hire a math tutor 2. enroll a student in foreign language classes 3. buy a home computer 4. attend a private school or home school a child.

And link every Minnesota school to the Internet and email.

I want Minnesota to be the number one state in computer technology.

For centuries, education has been the heart of the American dream.

To those of you who do not agree with our plan, I say, where is your plan? Do not underestimate my resolve on this issue.

Too many students are failing and we cannot afford to lose one more. I challenge every one of us to put students first.


As we look ahead to the 21st century, I am confident that Minnesota is poised for another exciting journey. It is a journey I pray we will encounter the same success we have seen over the last six years. A journey that will bring us closer together.

We have an incredible opportunity here. An opportunity to direct the needs of education to the child. A chance to make every system understand that our goal is to allow each child to reach his or her potential.

We can make our communities safer and become more committed to helping working families. We will make a commitment to the arts and building our soul within our community.

We can build a new baseball stadium without taxing the general public. We can refurbish the St. Paul Civic Center without taxing the general public.

We want a vibrant, growth-oriented economy which offers opportunity for all. We have taken the state from a deficit to a surplus. And we will cut taxes over $500 million this year.

Minnesota once was a national model. You and I working together are again going to make this the best state in America.Speaker Carruthers, President Spear, Chief Justice Blatz, members of the Supreme Court,

former Chief Justice Sandy Keith, Chief Judge Ed Toussaint, members of the Appellate

Court, former governors, Lieutenant Governor Benson, fellow constitutional officers,

legislators, friends and Minnesotans. And if I were to add all those desiring to run for

Governor, that would encompass the entire chamber.

You have been absolutely marvelous, and I thank you so much for both your kindness and all the courtesies that you have shown me over the past seven years. This past year, for all of us, has been a year of joy and personal sadness. We recently lost one of our most beloved Governors, C. Elmer Anderson of Brainerd, who served his state and his community so well for so long. He will always be a part of our memory and part of our history. We lost Ken Otremba and Barb Vickerman, two truly fine Legislators who exemplified the very best in public service. They, too, will always be a part of who we are. And Tim Bowe, the highly decorated State Trooper and a dear friend, who was truly one of Minnesota's finest. His loss was indeed painful.

On the other hand, we welcome to the Supreme Court our newest member, Jim Gilbert. We are delighted to have you and to also celebrate the elevation of Kathleen Blatz to Chief Justice.

I also want to take a moment to especially thank Sandy Keith for his leadership on the bench. When you look back over his splendid career, and I have admired it from a distance, and the closer I got to know him as Governor, the more I realized what a Minnesota treasure he has really been. He is truly one of Minnesota's greats, and we thank him on behalf of all Minnesotans for his service.

It is expected that the Governor of the State should comment on the state of the state. The truth today is that the state of the state is excellent. Minnesota is sturdy and well-prepared to enter the 21 st century. We are stronger financially, we are more prosperous and better prepared to take on the future than ever before in our history. And by forming partnerships, we have taken a state that was out of control in 1991, where we were spending $800,000 a day more than we were taking in, and we have been able, on a partnership basis, to turn that into a multi-billion dollar surplus. And we would not be talking about a $1.3 billion surplus, had we not cast, and had you not upheld, some 330 vetoes which blocked over $1.5 billion in new taxes, spending and fees.

Back in 1991, our budget reserves were exhausted, and now we have some $872 million in the bank -- money set aside to prepare us for whatever financial storms may lie ahead. We have repaid depleted reserves to the extent of $1.8 billion. Instead of spending 15 percent more than the rate of growth and personal income, we are now holding the rate of government spending below that key indicator. Incidentally, Minnesota's personal income is growing 30 percent faster than it is in the rest of America. We have not only halted the free-fall in our state's bond rating, but we have become the first state in some 24 years to recapture a triple-A bond rating from all three major financial rating institutions. There are only eight states in the United States that hold such a distinction. Perhaps best of all, we have gone from a state where we had cycles of endless tax and spending curves, and now we are in a position where we have so far been able to engage in more than a dozen tax cuts since 1991, giving back to taxpayers some $1.1 billion. And we are now proposing an addition of $1.7 billion in tax relief over the next five years, the largest in Minnesota's history.
I can accept the fact that a rising tide lifts all boats, and clearly we are delighted to be part of the national economy. But as Standard and Poor's indicated in their report, the economy is just a springboard. The other key is what you do with fiscal management. Now, we must also acknowledge that we could not have accomplished so much without adhering to the values embodied in this state and in its people -- values that call on us to grow first-rate jobs, to strengthen our quality of life and to show compassion for those in need. Minnesotans want a state where our children can find safety, opportunity, and breadth and richness of experience. We want a state that our children can be proud of, and today I am pleased to say I believe we are on that path.
Fifty-four thousand children who had no health insurance at the start of this decade are now covered through our MnCare program, ranking us second in the United States. We have become a national model for welfare reform, moving recipients not only into jobs, but much, much more importantly is lifting families out of poverty. 8,550 fewer families today rely on welfare than they did last year.
And while we are on the subject of jobs, we have also cut, on a bipartisan basis, workers' compensation premiums some 35 percent, saving employers $121 million and helping to create a competitive business climate that will continue to steadily grow jobs in Minnesota.
We have also begun to stem the rising tide of crime. In this last year, Minnesota has seen a decrease of seven percent in the most serious crimes, taking a step toward renewing our sense of security.
Now, I have reserved for the last reform, which is perhaps the most meaningful to me -education. We challenged the status quo and succeeded. We are now making decisions based upon what is best for the child, not the educational bureaucracy. And this month, for the first time ever, all of our public school students in grades three, five and eight are taking statewide standardized tests for reading and math, thereby giving parents, teachers, and the community a benchmark by which to judge their progress. Our first in the nation charter schools are setting new standards for innovation and flexibility. In just the last year, we have more than doubled to 30 the number of these creative schools. We have funded school technology, and within the next two years, we will be number one in America in the ratio of computers to students. For the first time ever, some of those students today are listening and watching this address on their computers at school via the Internet.
Our goal has been to put children first and, at the heart of all of our reforms, is our sincere belief that there must be competition in the educational system, whether public, private or parochial, every family in America should have the right to send their children to that school that best serves their child's needs.
Already, in this legislative session, there are those who seek to turn the clock back. But rest assured that, as Governor, I will do everything that I can to make certain that choice, competition, and quality continue to drive our commitment to education. I will fight to see that every single family in this state has the same educational choices for their children as the President, the Vice President, and all of our members of Congress.
We in America always define the American dream in the context of access to education. Millions of our families that came from foreign shores came here with that one ideal: that we could sacrifice our life, work hard so that our children could have access to the best educational experience, and on that basis, we could build the kind of egalitarian society that we all say that we want. We cannot, as a society, grant to the least -- the least amount of education -- but, rather, the same access that we give to those who have the most. That is what the American dream is all about. We in Minnesota will be the first state in America to realize that dream.
That also means that we are firmly committed to Minnesota's new graduation standards. The next century will demand more of our children, and we want to make absolutely certain that our children are prepared for that challenge. In all of this, as I have noted, we must be guided by those values that embrace Minnesota's people -- values, again, that call upon us to strengthen our quality of life, to show compassion for those in need and, first and foremost, to create an environment that is conducive to the growth of quality employment opportunities. Together, we have built an enviable record reforming education, reforming health care, reforming welfare, reforming state finances, reforming workers' compensation. The fact is that we have accomplished more solid reforms than any state in the United States.
Now, there will always be those who will look back and say, "Well, you can coast through the next Legislative session, while we await new leadership." But, I would remind them that competition waits for no one. Each and every year, we owe it to ourselves, and we owe it to the people of this state to endeavor to be better than we are. Now, granted, this state is enjoying its lowest unemployment rate ever. Granted, we are number one in the nation in job growth, more than 354,000 jobs have been grown over the past seven years. Granted, we have gone from a climate of job losses to one in which there are not enough skilled workers to fill available positions. The fact is, we do face new challenges. And we can either chose to ignore those challenges and see those successes gradually ebb away, or we can commit ourselves to change and to meeting the expectations that our people have of us. And to take advantage of the most precious resource that we have, which is our people.
It is my prayer that you and I, working together, can meet those challenges. We must strengthen the institutions that have always been the engines of job growth in this state -our institutions of higher learning. Never in our history has Minnesota needed higher education more than today. Never before have there been as many compelling reasons to justify bonding requests of $252 million for the University of Minnesota and $167 million . for the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities system, as well as those appropriations that are contained in our supplemental budget. These proposals must be funded in their entirety.
Now, much has been made of the size of the bond bill. But let me remind you that our package falls $200 million below our debt service guidelines. These requests are not simply requests for bricks and mortar. Our bill strengthens higher education. It enhances the environment and helps build communities throughout Minnesota. I want to thank Morrie Anderson, the new Chancellor at MnSCU for his leadership. He recognizes that 70 percent of the jobs we create in the future will not require a four-year degree but will require some post-secondary or technical training. To help students move into these jobs, part of our funding package calls for some $11 billion in new spending to forge partnerships between the MnSCU system and five high-growth Minnesota industries: precision manufacturing, computer software, printing and graphics, health and all of the occupations related to health and taconite production. Education and training programs in these key industries will be patterned after current successes. And what are they? A partnership with Northwest Airlines that will train air transport mechanics over the next two years. A partnership with IBM to help move students into high-paying jobs as computer systems network programmers. MnSCU is rapidly building a partnership between those people who create jobs and the whole system of education. That relationship, that partnership, is something you and I must invest in.
We also are blessed to not only have the outstanding leadership of Chancellor Anderson but also the vision of the new President of the University of Minnesota, Mark Yudof. In addition to his search for the all-American pancake, he has also laid out a sturdy vision for the future of the University and how it relates to all of us as citizens of the state of Minnesota. For over 150 years, we as citizens in this state, have invested in the University of Minnesota. In return, the University has given us educated citizens, advances in science and medicine, and a higher quality of life. Eighty percent of the students who graduate from the University of Minnesota remain citizens of this state.
Now, in order for these students to stay competitive with their peers across the nation and the world, we have proposed a number of key initiatives, including renovation of the Walter Library, a building in which all too few of us have spent any time. But it is truly one of the campus' oldest buildings, and the dream of the University of Minnesota is to transform it into a digital technology center. On the inside, students will have access to a state-of-the-art research facility. On the outside, we will preserve the building's elegant and distinctive architecture. We also proposed a new library at the University of Minnesota - Duluth's campus, designed to expand its capabilities into the largest information resource center in northeastern Minnesota. We proposed a new institute for molecular and cellular biology. As hard as it is for most of us to conceptualize, scientists have discovered that research at the cellular and molecular level is critical to scientific discovery. Through those discoveries, all of us win.
I want the University of Minnesota, through its research, to make us the lead state in the world in the development of medical technology. We have long excelled as a state in this area, and we must continue to be the leading light in medical education, medical training and medical research. Recall for a moment, that it was the University of Minnesota that trained Christiaan Barnard, who first performed the human heart transplant in 1967 and then went on to share his knowledge with countless other physicians. It was a year later that University of Minnesota physicians, Robert Good and Richard Hong made medical history by performing the world's first bone marrow transplant. And two decades later,

Minnesota was again inspiring the nation when a team led by Dr. Stuart Jamieson successfully performed the nation's first heart-lung transplant. That list goes on and on.
The reality is that the University of Minnesota and the Mayo Clinic are two of the finest medical institutions in the world, and we are committed to making absolutely certain that we give them the resources that are necessary for them to continue their work and to pursue excellence.
And it is for that reason that I am asking this Legislature to restore some $26 million in funding that was eliminated by the federal government. And why? To provide for medical research and medical education at both the University of Minnesota and the Mayo Clinic.
Now, if, as I have said, higher education is the engine that drives our job growth, then our business climate is the fuel that propels the train down the tracks. When I took office in 1991, one of the principal complaints was that Minnesota's high tax rates stifled economic growth. At that time, our commercial and industrial property tax rate stood slightly over 5 percent. It was far and away higher than our surrounding states, and very likely the highest in the United States. Now we have shrunk that rate down to some four percent. In the budget that I am submitting to you, I propose to reduce it down to the level of 3.5 percent and, for the apartment class, I want to reduce their rates down to 2.5 percent.
While this proposal will not cost the homeowner one dime, it will grow jobs, and it will grow our economy. In fact, if our plan is successful in this biennium and the next, tax relief will total some $2.4 billion. This spring, Minnesotans will receive a rebate equal to 20 percent of their property tax bill. We want that same tax relief extended through 1999. We believe that we must return the bulk of the surpluses to the taxpayers from whom it came.
But a large part of a healthy business climate also demands that we, as a state, follow on a very, very cautious and considerate course. We must have stable finances in order for our state to continue winning the competition for new jobs and new businesses.
As many of you know, I recently returned from a trade mission to Asia. I was privileged to have the opportunity to meet with the President of China, the Prime Ministers of Singapore and New Zealand, as well as their economic advisors. And I will tell you, it was sobering. The world faces a potential economic crisis if the United States and Japan do not act swiftly and wisely.
I left Asia wondering why, why we have shared in the upside of the market increase with record profits and then expect to not share in the downside. In light of those realities, I will again repeat my call for a separate reserve account dedicated to the Asian crisis. I want to make certain that we cushion any potential blow to our budget that may be caused by turmoil in those countries. Furthermore, I intend to ask this Legislature not only to set aside the $200 million I had previously recommended, but depending on the outcome of the February revenue forecast, to hold in reserve a total of $400 million, an increase of some $200 million. And then, if the impact of the Asian markets is less than anticipated and if the revenues prove to be sustainable, particularly in the out years, then the Legislature can come back with new leadership and use those funds to enact additional tax cuts. I think that is the prudent course for us to take as a state.

Lower taxes, a healthy economy and high quality jobs are the bread and butter issues that, by necessity, all of us care about. But Minnesotans value more than necessities. We also value that which enriches our souls. All those things, ranging from the arts to the great outdoors. Minnesota's outdoors are central to our quality of life. That is what we do with our families. We go to the lakes, we visit our state parks, we camp, we ski, we snowmobile, we hunt and some of us even try to fish. Our $202 million Access to the Outdoors initiative is an investment in an area that embodies our identity as a state. It builds upon this state's outstanding record of environmental protection, a record enhanced by more than $2.2 billion of investment since 1991, for projects that range anywhere from cleaning up the Minnesota River to improving our soil and air quality. This year, we seek to improve every state park in Minnesota. We want to add 100 miles of new trails, regenerate thousands of acres of forest and put many, many more acres into wildlife habitat. In addition, we want to make it simple to obtain recreational licenses through a one-stop shopping system that will be available at computer terminals all across the state.
Included in this comprehensive package is a new park of historic magnitude. It is the Veterans Memorial Park with the USS Des Moines as its centerpiece, to honor those to whom we owe our deepest debt of gratitude -- veterans who fought and died for the liberties that we now take for granted.
Those who served in World War II and the veterans of all wars, before and after, sacrificed greatly for us. Now they call upon us to make a small gesture in return. To those of you who have accused us of overzealousness on this project, I say that it is better to err on the side of caring too much than too little. I think it is better to push too fast and too hard than not at all. My prayer is that each governor from those generations that suffered through war will make absolutely certain that we remember those young men and those young women who risked and gave of their lives, so that we could enjoy the freedom that we have today.
The project in Duluth is designed not only as a memorial to the past and to those who served. It is also designed as a lesson, a reminder, to our young children. There were a
.lot of 17-year-olds and a lot of 18-year-olds who would have loved to have been home.
But, instead, they were asked to assault Okinawa and lwo Jima. They were asked to lose their lives and risk their lives at the Battle of the Bulge or to fly bombing missions over Berlin. And now they ask us, please remember those who gave so much of themselves for us. And I ask of you that we dedicate a monument to their courage, to their commitment, but also to our future.
Just as I call upon us to demonstrate compassion for those who have served so well, I am also calling on all Minnesotans to renew our commitment to the younger members of our society. Those of us who love this state -- and everyone here does --we know that we are a compassionate people. Few of us would ever turn our back on those in their time of need. Witness the tremendous outpouring of help during the floods last year. People from every corner of the upper Midwest volunteered to assist, volunteered to make someone's life better, and we identified with their tragedy.
That was a very visible crisis. Now there is mounting evidence that suggests that we are in the midst of another crisis, a silent one. Each year, thousands of babies are exposed to prenatal alcohol and, as a result, far too many of our children are subject to lifelong

disabilities, including mental retardation. Society -- we -- pay a rising price in costs for special education, out-of-home placements and corrections -- up to $1 million over the lifetime of a single victim. The tragedy is that it's all preventable. The bottom line is this: pregnant women cannot drink alcohol.
I particularly want to thank my wife, Susan, on behalf of this Administration and on behalf of the people of Minnesota, for her dedication, her leadership, and her genuine concern for our children. She has been not only a magnificent partner, but she truly loves those children. It is my prayer that when she and Judge Joan Lancaster submit their report tomorrow, that every single one of us will identify with their love and express our love in exactly the same way. They intend to present to us a comprehensive list of recommendations designed to combat this affliction. Our budget proposes $5 million in additional funding, so that they can press forward with education and prevention strategies. I very, very much want your support on this issue.
A compassionate people cannot tolerate our children starting out with one strike against them while in the womb. Nor, can we tolerate reports of children living in homeless shelters. The wonderful success story of our Minnesota economy has created thousands of jobs, record low unemployment and all of us feel a certain sense of security that was absent just a few years ago. Through our efforts to reform welfare, we, as a society, are now demanding that our brethren make every effort to work. The problem is that many of those first-time jobs may not pay much more than the minimum wage. As such, we have an obligation to ensure that there is sufficient affordable housing to meet the needs of every single one of our citizens.
In our supplemental budget, we have proposed $10 million to preserve apartments made more affordable through government assistance. Because federal assistance rates have not kept up with the marketplace, owners might well opt out of that program and therefore, the reliance on state help becomes greater and greater. Thousands of Minnesotans are now desperately seeking homes. In light of the severity of this problem, I am pledging to you today that we will increase our budget requests by an additional $5 million.
Serving the needs of troubled children and providing housing alternatives also forms the basis for our proposal to create the state's first residential academies, also called the boarding schools. We need to find a way to give children who have spent years bouncing around the foster care system a sense of permanency and a place to succeed. We also recognize that education is not a "one size fits all system". We know that people like former Minnesota Viking Joe Senser, who attended a residential academy, that without such a school, might well have landed in our criminal justice system.
I remember a few years ago talking to a young boy in one of our facilities in Minneapolis. He was a status offender. He was a runaway, a truant. He ran away because every time he went home, his father beat him within an inch of his life. And our system kept sending him back. We have to recognize that all parents are not equipped to be good parents. Our love, our commitment and our energies must focus entirely on the well-being of that child.
Now, we sit back as a body, and we complain about rising crime. We complain about the violence of adolescence, and we come in with strategies designed to lock them up for

longer and longer and longer. Until recently, we were on course to build a new prison every three years. But we began to recognize that if we could just focus more of our energies on preventing the problem, we could not only save an enormous amount of money, but we could save lives.
It is my hope that our entire system coming together -- judicial, executive and legislative -can focus entirely on the well-being of the child. Boarding schools become remarkable options to allow kids to escape from families that simply don't work -- families beset with violence, drugs, alcohol and crime; and allow them to go into a campus setting with a caring, dedicated, committed faculty and a community that truly wants them and say "We will work with you, and with our love, with our help, you will succeed." That is what it's all about.
The economic and human reality is that it costs us some $40,000 a year to keep a child at a juvenile detention center. That is more than an entire year's tuition at places like Harvard. We have to ask ourselves if it makes sense to spend money in that way, or does it make more sense to appropriate $12 million to build three residential academies so we can prevent some of these problems before they occur. It is my prayer that your answer will be a resounding "yes./I
We have in our audience some children from St. Joseph's Home in Minneapolis, whom I would like to now recognize. Today, we were led in prayer by Father Boxleitner of St. Joseph's. He and so many others, who work with children and who give their lives to the well-being of children, know full-well what this proposal means. It means a sense of permanency. It means an opportunity for success. Go back in your lives and every single one of you, at a point of stress, at a point of despair, had someone come to you, put a hand on your shoulder and say, "I'll help you."
That is precisely what we must do with our young people. In every single one of our endeavors, we must continue to focus on their well-being. I want them, all of our children, to grow up in an environment that focuses on opportunity over entitlement. To become part of a society that is healthy and is competitive, and that each of them is free to pursue their own individual happiness and to do it in such a way that it builds a sense of community.
We all, particularly those of us who are elected, recognize how fragile a democracy is. We recognize that our communities expect the very best from us. It has been my privilege to have served for the past eight years as governor of this state. It has been an even greater privilege to have had the opportunity to serve for some 30 years. And it has indeed been a tremendous honor to work with you on both sides of the aisle, building the kinds of coalitions and partnerships necessary to focus on our future.
When I opened my speech this afternoon, I talked about how well positioned we were to enter the next century. But in order for us to be well positioned, we had to develop policy, we had to engage in contentious debate and we had to seek alternatives. But at all times, we had the obligation to focus on the future. Our dream as an administration was "Don't focus on the moment. Don't cave into the immediate needs, but rather keep your eye on the long term./I Think of what it will be like to walk by the Capitol 20 years from now and

to be able to say, 'Well, I remember back in 1993 we started this. And in 1992, we did this. And in 1996, we did that. "' And the truth is, if we have done our job right, then we can look back with a tremendous amount of joy and say, "I'm honored and delighted to have served." To all of you, I can only say thank you. Thank you for your courtesies. Thank you for your kindness. I particularly want to thank the leadership. I know how much is expected of you. To those who have served in the past and those who serve today, I am told that some 70 percent of the members of this body were not here in 1991. Let me tell you, you did not miss much! But to Speaker Carruthers, to President Spear, Majority Leader Moe, Minority Leader Senator Day, Minority Leader Steve Sviggum, and to all of the leadership that has served in prior years, I thank you so much for engaging and procuring. I can honestly say I think the people of Minnesota are extraordinarily well-served. Every community has the obligation to give us its best and its brightest. And we can simply act on that expectation. And I sincerely pray that we always keep our eyes on the future. And the future is our children. My dream, my personal dream is that some day one of those young people, a young person in trouble, a young person who is helped with the hand on the shoulder, will be standing here as your Governor. Thank you very much!
I come to the House chamber with great respect to deliver the 1999 State of the State Address for the State of Minnesota 120 days after our general election. In an era marked by professional political machinery that surrounds both candidates and elected officials, I began in a unique position. I went to the transition office in the basement of the Capitol alone the day after the election.

I brought my convictions, born of life experience, the freedom of having made no promises on the campaign trail that I couldn't keep. I brought my commitment to learn and become an excellent governor. I brought a belief in my ability to build and lead the best executive branch of government this state has ever seen ... the most honest, the most service-minded, the most accountable, the most committed to results for the people of Minnesota.

I also brought to the job three fundamental beliefs that are very, very important to understanding how I will govern:

First, said best by Abraham Lincoln - the role for government is to do only what the people cannot do for themselves. There is not a person in Minnesota who does not wish to individually pursue the Constitutional entitlements to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Government should promote this type of self-sufficiency, not stand in the way. There is, after all, a place for common sense and restraint. We can't legislate against every stupid thing people will do, and yet the temptation is there to try time and time again. Every time government burdens the people with nonsense like rules that dictate how to butter bread in nursing homes â and believe it or not, that is a real government regulation â we remove any incentive for doing good work.

Second, I believe in personal responsibility and self-sufficiency.

The State of the State is jeopardized by this weak notion that taxpayers must step forward to provide nearly unlimited resources to anyone who faces adversity... who lives with circumstances they brought about through their own decisions... or who lives with consequences of choices to act illegally.

I stand before you as Governor willing to say what too many politicians at all levels of government have been scared to say: the free ride is over.

The election debate was littered with promises of tax cuts, but how in the world
can we accomplish that if we don't reform an expectation for "entitlements?"
You can't convince me that people value something that they get for free more
than something that they earn. It is hard to say "NO," but we elected leaders
must learn how if we intend to accomplish greater things for Minnesota. Public
funds spent on investments, like education, rather than direct entitlements will
benefit everyone now and in the future.
And finally, I believe that greatness in this state can only continue with an
active, involved citizenry.
If you wonder where I am getting my support for this candid approach to
governing, let me introduce you to some of the people who told me it was time for
this new day in state government. Up in the gallery are two very important
groups of advisors who gave this advice during the transition when we spent the
first month listening and learning.
Thanks are owed to the young people who came in during the second week of
the transition and talked about their hopes for this new day. Thanks are also
owed to the group of first time voters, randomly selected from the Secretary of
State's voter registration lists, who spoke about what it will take to KEEP them
involved. Legislature, please join me in welcoming these Minnesotans here
today.
"People -- this is your House of Representatives and Senate convened together
for this address. We are YOUR elected officials ... 201 of them and one of me ...
we are your public servants. It is my intention that during these years you will be
welcome here â more welcome than I was when I visited this chamber floor as a
citizen last year -- and was asked three times to sit down in a chair where I could
not see anything. Let me tell you, it is good to have you here today -- and it's
good to be standing."
To the first time voters and to the young people, I say again what I have said
before: We dare not lose you,. To the legislature, I utter this challenge -- make this Capitol a welcoming place. Inspire the citizens in your home districts. Help
your local elected officials run good, open meetings that are responsive to citizen
input. Do the right things. Vote your conscience, not your caucus.
The State of the State is that the people are very tired of business as
usual.
One way or another, there will be more than 70 percent voting at the polls in the
next election and the one after that. The people will either come out to keep their
governor, their legislators, their congressmen, their mayors, county
commissioners, and school board members -- or oust us. But they are awake,
and Minnesota will be greater for them exercising the right to vote. Generations
of Minnesotans have fought to protect that right on American soil and around the
world.
I want to see an active PTA in every school building, not just the 270 that are left
today.
o Chambers of Commerce where the room is full of PRIVATE sector
business people who are not outnumbered by public employees,
o Youth groups like 4-H and Scouts and after school clubs full of
interested kids and their parents who want to make a difference for
themselves and others.
o Active veterans groups serving those who have served.
o And a renewed interest in volunteering for service clubs, local
chapters of state organizations, and neighborhood efforts.
The State of the State improves every time a citizen, young or old, gets
involved.
This is the State of the State as I see it at the end of the Transition months.
Regarding the State of the Minnesota government, I am well qualified to give
this Address today â¢ in fact, I will venture that I am more in touch with state
government than any Governor in recent times at this point in my term. I set foot
in every department and major agency, met with the staff, met many employees
who do the real work of serving the people, and laid hands on their budgets
personally. I met employees who had worked 30 years for the State and never
met a Governor. It should not be a "shock the world" event when the Governor
visits the State Department of Revenue.
Ladies and gentlemen, the first job of the Governor is to run the Executive
Branch of government. We are working very hard to span a tragic disconnect
between the Capitol building and the 35,000 state employees who perform the
functions that are authorized and appropriated by previous legislatures.

How many of you here were newly elected this year? PLEASE RAISE YOUR
HANDS. Fully 15 percent of the house are newly elected. Like you, I had eight
short weeks to get ready for consideration of a $33 BILLION expenditure of the
people's money. How many of you -- all of you, not just the newly elected
legislators -- have taken time in the last year to personally visit every department
who's budget you will vote on? It took me one month to see all of this huge state
government.
We must reform how we do business. We must reform the tendency to vote first
and learn later. Or, worse yet, never take the time to learn and simply fall in line
behind a caucus position for bargaining purposes.
The Constitutional Separation between the Executive and Legislative Branches
of Government is not intended to be one born of partisan, adversarial politics.
We each have a very distinct job to do in a healthy process of checks and
balances.
Within one week of my election, I set three top priorities: budget, budget,
budget. There was no other choice; the system requires that the budget books
be submitted by mid-February. I led that process. I don't care what the media
decided to focus your attention on -- that's what I was doing. It started with
budget principles that are clear and written down for everyone to see. Today I
am releasing mine to you in a handy wallet form, and putting them on the web
site for public use.
They boil down to this:
Be fiscally prudent -- never, ever forget it's the public's money
â¢ Do what's necessary ... not what's nice to do.
â¢ Prevent future costs where possible.
â¢ Insist that projected budgets are balanced for four years
â¢ Set a responsible budget, live within it, and settle-up any actual surpluses
with taxpayers at the end of the biennium. (On this point, let me just
acknowledge the incredibly large elephant standing with us in this room.
As soon as you're ready to send me a sales tax rebate bill, I'm ready to
sign it and get on to permanent income tax cut discussions.)
Do the right things and do them well
â¢ We must start evaluating programs for results.
â¢ We can't ever hesitate to reform or eliminate programs if they aren't
producing results.
â¢ Every new program should automatically have a "sunset" clause that
forces proper evaluation.

And finally, we must create incentives, not penalties, for individuals and
governments to do the right things.
â¢ Competition works and is even good in government.
â¢ We need to put responsibility and accountability together at all levels of
government.
â¢ We must move decisions to the level closest to the people ... no unfunded
mandates from one unit of government to the next.
â¢ We must creatively leverage private and non-profit support. No more one
to one entitlement thinking -- we need to use investment thinking where
one dollar begets 3 or 5 or 9 more ... just like in tourism.
â¢ And my administration will support fees over general taxes where users
have a voice in the rates and the program results.
When you bring your ideas to my administration, be you a citizen, or a lobbyist,
or a legislator or a state employee, bear these beliefs and principles in mind. For
as long as I am Governor, there will be no surprises about why I am signing or
vetoing legislation. Simply look at this list and my rationale should be abundantly
clear. These are my beliefs and principles unless I am convinced through a
visible, public debate that they need to be changed.
Already, I see the problems clearly. First, the executive branch is the only one
that enters the legislative session with a budget that reveals a whole picture of
tax and spend. We base this on the November economic forecast. However,
eight weeks into the Session, neither the House or the Senate has yet to reveal
its spending targets and choices in an accountable way to the people.
Until we stop measuring the success of a legislative session by how many bills
are heard or passed, there is no hope of controlling spending or the sprawl of
government regulation. It's my job to set a vision, not flood this place with pieces
of legislation. It all starts by staying honest to the beliefs and principles that I
have presented in this State of the State Address.
The State of the State is in good hands. The Governor's Office has been
restructured to support the works of these commissioners and directors ... not the
other way around. They are here seated in the center section of the gallery.
Public sector, private sector, Democrats, Republicans, Reform Party,
unaffiliated. What binds us are beliefs in a new day where ideas -- not money --
govern how we work. Who speaks for me? They do. With years of experience,
good judgment, and a strong sense of what needs to be done to serve the
people. That is my leadership commitment to the people of Minnesota -- to hire
the best and brightest and lead as every good CEO leads -- by articulating the
vision, by stating clear expectations, and by holding people personally
accountable through good management practices.

SINCE THE STATE OF THE STATE IS GREAT ... THEN WHERE DO WE GO
FROM HERE?
Any good competitor knows that when you're ahead, you don't rest on your
laurels. Don't get nervous or defensive. You continue to do what you do best,
and hold the lead. It's time to focus on staying competitive and position the state
to keep winning even when the challengers get tougher. Three years from now, I
want my State of the State speech to start out the same way this one did: that
the State of the State is, indeed, great and got greater during the Ventura
Administration. I didn't come here to tinker around the edges of things that need
fixing and I'm willing to tackle the big questions.
QUESTION TWO: Who is responsible for urgently helping the children who
aren't going to pass the Minnesota graduation standards tests in June,
2000? The goal of this administration is to build the strongest public education
system in the world ... but it is only as effective as the resolve of every parent to
step up and be the first and most important teacher a child will have. On that I
will not give an inch. It's so easy to blame the governor, the legislature, teachers,
the school board -- when in reality nothing is successful without every parent
making good decisions, every day, in the best interests of each child. Last month
I recommended nearly $600 million in new investments in is-12 education,
including a very important incentive fund of $150 million for reducing class sizes
Kindergarten through Grade Three. It is my goal to erase the word voucher from
the vocabulary by investing in public education and expecting local school boards
to deliver results.
Now the biggest questions lie ahead.
How can we create a performance-based funding system for Minnesota schools
which ends this complicated funding "shell game" that nobody can understand
any more?
â¢ How can the state give incentives for schools and teachers and students
to do their best without micro managing from the Capitol?
â¢ What will local elected leaders do in every school district to make their
public schools the strongest they can be into the 21st Century?

NEXT QUESTION: If there aren't six people left in the State who can explain
the property tax formula, and none of them think it's fair, why don't we start
over? Let's face it ... we've lost any logic to this system. Property taxes no
longer are tied to the services that are delivered. We have created a so-called
"progressive" tax based on the value of property. It punishes people for doing
the right thing. If I keep up my property, my value and taxes go up even though I
don't need as many local services as the property that has been allowed to
deteriorate and needs inspections, fire protection, or police patrols. It's time to
quit taxing senior citizens out of homes that they own, and force them into
nursing homes or assisted living. It's time to confront the inequities of how we
fund public schools, and how unfair that is to children and taxpayers in
communities all over Minnesota. Even well-intentioned "fixes" end up making the
system more complicated, and one taxpayer's fix becomes another taxpayer's
problem. Reforming the property tax system is one of my administration's
highest priorities.
HERE'S ANOTHER QUESTION: What other tax reforms need
consideration? We need good reforms that are actually put in place rather
than sit on a shelf somewhere. Revenue Commissioner Matt Smith has the job
of untangling this complicated question through a combination of research and
public involvement. We need to pay careful attention to defend our economy
against competition from neighboring states and world markets. It doesn't take
much for Minnesota consumers to migrate over the borders where sales tax or
motor vehicle license fees are lower. Our taxpayers are also calling for income
tax relief, and that demands both immediate and long-term response from
government. We will follow through by tough discipline on spending and action
on tax reforms.
QUESTION: How do we prepare our economy for the future?
Under Trade & Economic Development Commissioner Jerry Carlson, there is a
new strategy to market Minnesota. The vision is as big as the world, and my
administration intends to work with interested businesses and communities to
expand exports and increase investment in Minnesota.
The strategy is about selling tourism and business development, developing
export markets, attracting films, licensing technology, and creating opportunities.

As Governor, I am not an ambassador out there to make people feel good. I'm a
salesman -- I'm out to sell results. When I travel abroad, it will be with a serious
economic plan, well thought through. The trip planned for fall to Japan is the
first effort. Some of you may know that Japanese television carried my
inauguration on national television. With such interest in Minnesota, I would be
foolish not to explore that interest for the betterment of our entire state's
economy.
The urgency of my administration's strategy for new market development is seen
most in the agricultural part of the economy. Short term money relief will not
solve long term agricultural problems. The commissioners of Agriculture, Trade
& Economic Development, Commerce, Finance, and Revenue are working side
by side to invest state tax dollars in projects and programs that truly achieve
economic self-sufficiency. Yes, it is right to step forward and ease a crisis that
affects a specific group of farmers. I have recommended 10 million dollars in
targeted relief for that purpose. My cabinet's recommendation is to provide relief
over the next few years because this is not a one year problem. Commissioner
Gene Hugoson is entrusted to address the long term needs with a vision that
goes beyond the current crisis to get results for agriculture. I am willing to invest
an additional $50 million, for a total of $60 million, in relief over the next three
years to help farm families who are truly in need.
ANOTHER BIG QUESTION: Why don't we have a transportation system
that works after 25 years of investing in planning? I want to stop planning to
do something about transit and urban sprawl and get something DONE. Our
roads have grown more congested and the Twin Cities region has become one
of the most sprawling in the country. In Minnesota, every day an area the size of
the Mall of America gets paved over, and we're still "planning" to do something
about transit and sprawl. I want a transit system that gives people choices, so
they can get where they want to go, when they need to get there. I'll know we're
successful when I can ride light rail from downtown Minneapolis to the Megamall,
and take commuter rail from St. Cloud to the Twin Cities. It's time for action on
transportation, and it's in the hands of Metropolitan Council Chair Ted Mondale
and Transportation Commissioner El Tinklenberg to develop an action plan that
makes sense for the whole state.
AND THE LAST QUESTION IS: What do we do with the one-time tobacco
money?
My commitment to endowing the tobacco settlement money is tied to my belief in
self-sufficiency and improving the lives of Minnesotans. My resolve to endow the
money has grown even stronger since last week when I joined all the national
governors in a meeting with President Clinton. He made it abundantly clear that
the federal government will demand reimbursement for Medicare from the
proceeds of the settlement if it is not used for human services and health care
purposes. These payments, totaling $1.3 billion over five years, are a windfall to

the state of Minnesota ... not an over collection of taxes. It is a once in a lifetime
opportunity to invest in ourselves and our future. I am proposing four
endowments that protect the principal entirely. The interest earnings would be
spent in four areas of self-sufficiency:
It is my hope and expectation that this legislature will consider and agree that
there every reason to invest these resources for the betterment of our health and
all of humanity.
WHAT PRICE TAG GOES ON YOUR HEALTH?
In summary, here is my vision as your new Governor:
ONE -- I want the best public education system in the world, including
higher education.
TWO -- I want a smaller, more efficient government. I envision a more simple
tax system, a more strategic and successful state government working in
partnership -- not against -- local units of government, and a unicameral
legislature that spends at least one year out of four cleaning old and intrusive
laws off the books.
THREE -- I want trade and economic development to be the engine of my
administration.
FOUR -- I want to ride a train by 2002.
FIVE -- I want every person hearing this speech to invest what you can do for
yourself. This notion of self-sufficiency is far from a new idea -- its a Minnesota
idea. It's in our roots and in the character of the people.

they are reforming the world immediately around them by what they do and how
they do it.
Today, as we celebrate that the State of the State is great, let us celebrate five
people who are reforming Minnesota for the better every day through their good
works ... one for each of the months since the election. They are here today to
receive the first Governor's Awards for a Better Minnesota.
Seated in the gallery -- and I would ask that you rise to be recognized as I call
your names:
Last month I had the privilege of presenting the Minnesota Health and Housing
Alliance Caregiver of the Year Award to Johnnie Penrod for 27 years as a
nurses' aide at the Masonic Nursing Home in Bloomington. Any of us who has
ever put a parent into a nursing home hopes that someone who is as
compassionate as Johnnie was there when we could not be. Every caring word
spent in these years of service has made Minnesota a better place.
Joe Lynch, 14 years old, is an 8th grader at St. Bernard's school in St. Paul. Joe
was one of the students who believed in and built a playground last summer
against all odds. When the adults backed out, worried that a playground would
attract gangs and violence, four teams of young believers stepped up to work on
fundraising, a location, equipment, and safety issues. With help from the
Humphrey Institute's Public Achievement project and many businesses and St.
Paul leaders, there is now a better place on the corner of Geranium Street.
Twice during the transition, I was invited to see research projects at the
University of Minnesota. One of those trips was to the Cancer Center, where I
met dedicated researchers seeking new ways to prevent and cure disease.
While this Capitol building preoccupies itself with talk of tobacco settlements, Dr.
Dorothy Hatsukami is unlocking mysteries about nicotine addiction. How and
why do some people become addicted? These and other answers from her
fellow researchers are making Minnesota a better place.
Minneapolis is a better place because of Sam Costa. In January, I was invited to
attend a celebration at Powderhorn School honoring Sam's role in the life of that
neighborhood. A teacher and choreographer, Sam has touched the lives of
many, young and old, in ways that will never, ever be forgotten. Sam served on
the Partners: Arts and Schools for Students (P.A.S.S.) and Minnesota Dance

Affiance boards. He founded the Twin Cities-based contemporary repertory
dance company, 10,000 Dances, and served as the Artistic Director of Young
Dance, a Twin Cities' youth dance company. We honor you today for making
your corner of the world a better place.
Please join me in recognizing these outstanding Minnesotans.
First time voters, young people, and honored Minnesotans -- I offer you these
thoughts with great respect that the future is much more in your hands than in
mine -- or this legislature's. You and the other people must speak to tell us
whether you will participate to make this new day truly work in Minnesota.
It's been said that "The world belongs to those who show up."
Thank you for showing up today. I, too, am very happy to be here.
Thank you.
Mr. Speaker,

Mr. President, and honorable Legislators.

Thank you for allowing me the privilege of this prestigious venue to deliver my

second state of the state address.


Governor Wendell Anderson,

Governor Harold Stassen;

Thank you for corning here today--and on behalf of all the people of Minnesota-- let me once again thank you for your service to this great state.

(Please stand and be acknowledged)

Lt. Governor Mae Schunk.

Thank you for your loyalty and dedication to this administration and our goals.

, Welcome to the constitutional officers:

Attorney General Mike Hatch.

Secretary of State Mary Kiffmeyer.

State Auditor Judi Dutcher, and

State Treasurer Carol Johnson.

To the Chief Justice,
The Associate Justices of the Supreme Court, and
The Minnesota Court of Appeals,
your attendance is indeed an honor.
To my Commissioners, my staff, my friends -- from the bottom of my heart--thank you for your hard work and loyalty.
And finally, thank you to my family for being with me here today.
It's been an interesting two years in the state of Minnesota.
And it's been a good two years.
How do I know that?
The people told me.
In the last two years I have traveled to every comer of this state and listened to the people.
And so while I have a ton of statistics to prove that the state of the state is good Ñ I come here today with something even better than numbers:
I come here fortified with the hugs, the smiles, and the encouraging words of the people.
And those words are comforting.
In Alexandria and Alvarado I got off a bus and mingled with some very hardworking people who have helped make this the great state it is.
In Albert Lea I met meat packers who help make Minnesota one of the top food processing and packaging states in the nation.
And in Becker, Belgrade, Big Lake and Bemidji I saw hard working young people chipping in as part of the best workforce in the world.
A workforce that for the last two years has had one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation. Business comes to Minnesota because we not only work hard, but we know how to work smart.
In many towns throughout Minnesota it was pointed out to me that, while we need to remain vigilant, people are appreciative that the Pollution Control Agency is working closely with the Department of Agriculture and the



Department of Natural Resources to preserve and safeguard our environment.
In Bloomington I learned of the resources we have available for abused women and their families. But I also learned of the terrible toll domestic abuse takes on our society.
I listened to these advocates and I learned.
In Callaway, where it seemed the whole town came out to greet me, I was overwhelmed by the confidence people had in themselves and in our ability to do what is right for them.
In Chatfield, I got a haircut. Really.
And I saw a main street struggling to remain vital in a changing rural economy.
I took note.
In Cold Spring I toured a brewery. A brewery that is a classic example of adapting business strategies to a changing world.
I learned that all over our state businesses are adapting.
In fact, in the last two years our Department of Trade and Economic Development assisted over 205 projects committed to the creation of 600 jobs, 82% of which were in rural Minnesota.
Adapting to a changing economy. It is what will make a good state better.
In Crane Lake I caught some fish. And that day, especially for my family and me, the state of the state was good.
Thank you Crane Lake--you did yourself proud.
Fishing, golfing, swimming, hiking, boating, skiing, snowmobiling, canoeing, the arts, sports and even shopping, make this state a good state to visit.
In the last two years I have worked hard to promote tourism. And in the next two years I will work even harder.
In the last two years tourism in Minnesota has grown by over 10% a year and is now a $10 BILLION dollar industry.
I traveled to a lot of towns this past year and met a lot of people whose livelihoods depend on tourism.
Towns like Duluth and Detroit Lakes.
It is towns like these that I have in mind when I travel to Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and Japan and urge their citizens to experience Minnesota.
I traveled to towns where the people are proud of their natural resources and work hard to preserve them from the growth of our cities.
I saw where the rivers meet in Elk River, I played golf in Eden Prairie, and I was charmed by the people in Fertile.
I had lunch at the Whistle Stop in Frontenac and was serenaded by singers in Fulda.
In Eveleth I was deeply concerned and in Hoyt Lakes I was sad.
Life is good in Minnesota, but not for everyone.
But I also have experienced Minnesota's ability to persevere.
In tiny Heidelberg I was overwhelmed by the sincerity and kindness shown to me by two of the most entrepreneurial spirits in Minnesota.
Laura Odenthal and her husband Randy took advantage of a new state meat inspection program and developed a direct marketing outlet for their meat products.
And, believe it or not, Laura and Randy produced a bratwurst made from alligator and pork and sold over 2,500 pounds of the product at the State Fair.
The entrepreneurial spirit is what makes this a state above all states. The ultimate resource in a goal of self-sufficiency is the can do attitude.
Our state is full of entrepreneurial role models.
Donn and Sarah Kreofsky developed Lark Toy Company in Kellogg, Minnesota and built the most unusual carousel you will ever see.
You know how many people visited that carousel in Kellogg last year?
750,000 people. Yes, three quarters of a million people.
For hard working, innovative and creative people like the Kreofskys, the state of the state is good.
But while most of us are enjoying the good life, things around us are changing.
In Long Prairie, Marshall and New Trier the agricultural economy continues to evolve; and in Mankato, Minnetonka, Moorhead and Minneapolis ecommerce continues to expand.
In Owatonna property taxes are projected to go up 14%. In Morris the
projection is a 16% increase, in Apple Valley 20%, in New Hope 30% and in Bemidji and Delano 35%.

In Rochester many thousands of health care workers struggle to keep us healthy.

I've been out there and I have gotten a message.

And the message is:

Things around us, the economy, health care, communications, are changing at a rapid pace, and government policy must change accordingly.

Today I am bringing you the Ventura Administration's agenda for that change:

Bold change for a new economy and a new way of life in Minnesota.

A way of life that includes a 21 st century tax system, a 21 st century
telecommunications infrastructure, a 21 st century education system and a 21 st century government to guide us through this fast paced world.

Let us begin with bold, responsible tax reform.

We are poised to provide Minnesota citizens with a reformed tax system that not only lightens their load, but also makes the tax system more fair, simple and accountable to taxpayers.

I also want our tax laws to support Minnesota workers and businesses to compete and win in the globally competitive marketplace.

The tax changes I will present to the 2001 legislature will lay an important and ambitious agenda before lawmakers and citizens for the coming months.

Yes, they will be controversial.

Yet I believe that addressing those issues now is crucial to the long term best

interests of the citizens of Minnesota.

I ask you to join me in a constructive dialogue that can successfully tum these goals into reality by the close of the legislative session.

Over the past year and a half, my administration has worked with many of you, local government officials and citizens, to develop a good understanding of concerns and hopes for a better tax system.

What have we heard and learned in that process?

Our "big three" taxes, property, income, and sales tax, together account for 3

out of every 5 dollars that citizens pay for state and local government in Minnesota.
And each of the big 3 has its own big problems:
The property tax is a complicated shell game that frustrates citizen involvement, and lets both state and local governments evade responsibility 'for their spending and taxing decisions.
And all too often, responsibility for local spending decisions is camouflaged by levy limits, state aid payments, and a tax structure that places too much of the tax burden on those who don't even get to vote.
All of this makes it impossible for the property tax to be what it was originally intended:
A local tax, controlled by the community, with local officials and citizens accountable for its use.
The property tax also puts an unfairly high burden on businesses and rental housing, which hurts our competitiveness and creates economic development barriers in many parts of our state.
And finally, many Minnesotans, including myself, question the basic fairness of the property tax as a way to pay for government.
How much does the value of a property really have to do with how much it costs government to serve it, or the ability of the owner to pay the tax?
All too often, not much.
The property tax needs to be reformed so it is smaller, simpler, fairer, and more truly a local tax, and we can do it, this year.
In my budget,
I will propose that the state take over the full costs of the K through 12 general education formula and eliminate the state-mandated general education levy by local school districts.
Combined with other changes to the property tax system, this will result in net property tax relief of over $800 million annually to all types of property across Minnesota,
Including double digit percentage property tax reductions to:
businesses,
homes, apartments,
farms, and
cabins.
And be assured that property tax relief will benefit all parts of our state.
I will propose reforms to restrict local school districts to levying special referendums on residential property because let's face it, they are the ones that vote for them and benefit from them.
Today, businesses, cabin owners and farmers experience taxation without representation when it comes to these voter approved levies.
Everyone needs to pay their fair share, but I will propose that businesses and cabins that have no local vote will pay tax at a uniform statewide rate instead.
And farmland will be exempted from both the local operating referendum and the statewide tax.
I will propose increases in the state "circuit breaker" property tax refund, to help seniors and others with fixed incomes cope with the effects of rising property values and taxes.
And I will propose that what remains of the property tax be made more clearly a local tax, locally decided, locally controlled and accountable:
by eliminating the sales tax on local governments,
by beginning to take state funding responsibility for some mandated juvenile protection costs now borne by county governments and the property tax,
by avoiding levy limits,
by reforming state aid formulas to cities so they better reflect local needs and resources,
and by improving the quality and understandability of taxpayer information so citizens can participate more effectively in local spending and taxing decisions.
Another tax many people have told me is unfair is the income tax.
A tax that's given our state more notoriety than our 10,000 lakes.
Yes, we have been working on lowering them, and over the last two years the income tax has been substantially reduced. Still, we have the 10th highest top rate and the third highest starting rate in the nation.
What kind of a message does that send about how much we value work and individual self sufficiency?
Those high income tax rates also make it harder to attract and keep skilled workers in our state, the very people we need if our economy is to continue to grow.
Our income tax rates need to be lowered again for all taxpayers, and we can do it, this year.
In my budget,
I will propose an across the board reduction in state income tax rates that will reach .5% in all three brackets, and
I will propose increases in the Working Family Credit to ensure that work is rewarded at all income levels in our state.
There is one tax that many people believe is fair (or at least as fair as any tax can be!): the sales tax.
People say it feels like they can control it, that the payment of the sales tax is their choice, not the government's.
1agree with them, and I want our state to rely more on the sales tax, and less on the income and property taxes in the future.
But the sales tax has some problems, too:
Right now, the sales tax is out of step with a modem economy.
The fact is our society is more and more service based.
Think about this.
On average, about forty percent of the purchases you make today are for goods. Things like hammers, books, tires and snow shovels.
All these items are taxable.
But about sixty percent of purchases are for services. Things like haircuts, piano tuning, boat docking, dating services, and car washes.
Things that mostly go untaxed.
This 60/40 split is almost the exact reversal of what existed in the years when

our sales tax was developed.

It's time we change our tax system to reflect our economy.

The sales tax faces some other problems, too:

The growth of ecommerce and sales over the Internet, while essential for economic growth, also causes a growing tax loss because sellers from outside Minnesota don't collect our sales tax and, in the process, put our Minnesota retailers at a competitive disadvantage.

We must find a way, working with other states, to create a way for out of state sellers to charge and collect our sales tax, just as our in state businesses must.

If we don't, more and more of the tax burden will be shifted to those who find themselves on the wrong side of the "digital divide" and that's not fair.

Finally, we have a high state sales tax rate, at 6.5 percent, it is the 3rd highest in the country, a leftover from the state budget problems of the early 90's. And one of the few "adjustments" from that era we have yet to undo.

Our sales tax needs to apply more fairly to all parts of a modem economy, at a

lower rate, and it needs to be preserved and enhanced as a reliable source of tax

revenue for the future, and we can do it, this year.

In my budget, and in concert with other Governors across the nation,

I will propose administrative and definitional changes designed to align Minnesota's sales tax system with those of other states and create a national, streamlined state sales tax system that can:

Help solve the internet sales problem,

Create a level playing field for Minnesota based retailers, and

Preserve the sales tax as a revenue source for the future.

I will propose a reduction in the state sales tax rate to 6 percent.

And in what will perhaps be the most controversial aspect of my tax reform plan:

I will propose that Minnesota broaden its sales tax base to include services as well as goods, while continuing to exempt life essentials like food, clothing, and heating fuels.

This particular reform is so important that I am going to say again what I said earlier:


As responsible representatives of the people we cannot ignore that we have a sales tax in Minnesota, built and designed on the late 60's economy. It is riddled with exemptions and totally ignores a huge and growing segment of our economy.
This is a tough one.
This change will take tremendous political courage.
But I am asking the legislature and the people of this state, to stand with me and take this issue on.
And in the end, I hope you will make a bold move to position our state for more good economic times.
Minnesota's future is increasingly global and competitive.
And to make sure Minnesota remains an attractive, competitive place to live and do business we must reduce and reform other taxes as well.
In my budget, in addition to reductions in business property taxes:
I will propose reductions in corporate income taxes to help make Minnesota based firms more competitive.
And in connection with my sales tax reform recommendations,
I will also propose expanded sales tax exemptions for. materials and equipment that will help lower the cost of operating here.
Tax reform and relief don't end with the big 3 taxes, though.
There's also my favorite "bad" tax.
The motor vehicle registration tax.
It was a bad tax last year when we lowered the tax to a maximum of $99 from the third to tenth years, and it's still a bad tax.
In my budget,
I will propose that we continue to move toward my original goal that no one ever pay more than $75 dollars for license tabs.
And finally, in each recent session of the legislature, we have faced a continuing call to reform the way we pay for the Minnesota Care Program..
Making health insurance available at affordable prices is a good thing, but paying for it through taxes on prescription drugs, HMO premiums, and an

increasing tax on health care providers is not.
Therefore, in my budget:
I will propose a repeal of the wholesale prescription drug tax, the HMO premium tax, and permanently setting the health care provider tax at 1.5%.
Lower, reformed property taxes, lower income taxes, a lower sales tax rate, Along with all the other changes I've described, I think you'll agree is an ambitious agenda for tax reform, you might even call it a BIG PLAN!
I know that all of you share some of my goals, some of you share most of them, and a few of you may even share all of them.
But you're probably wondering, can we accomplish all of it this year?
I believe we can.
It requires only two things, but they're big things, and we will need to do both of them.
First, we must hold down spending growth.
We must hold spending down so we can combine tax relief with tax reform, and as a result, taxes overall can be lower, simpler and fairer.
My budget will do that.
Second, we must be bold and face the challenges of building a tax system, and especially a sales tax system, for the 21st century.
I know, and you know, that tax reform is not for the faint-hearted, especially when times are good.
But I also know, and I think you do too, that many of the changes I have described today are long overdue.
All of this requires us to look bravely at the status quo, raise questions and challenge the complicated system we have today.
As we work together to challenge this system, let us do it without mis information and mischaracterization of what this plan is really about.
This plan is not about raising taxes. It's about making a tax system fairer.
Over all it's about cutting taxes.
And in the end it is about the ability for all Minnesotans to have more money in their pockets and for the State of Minnesota to have less in theirs.


But while taxes are a huge concern there are other important reforms that Minnesota will need to be competitive in the new economy.
Minnesota has not completed a major overhaul of its telecommunications laws for over 80 years!
That means the last time we overhauled our telecommunications law, there were no cellphones, no Internet, no cable TV, no such thing as digital or high speed access.
The telecommunications world of today is completely different than the one of 80 years ago. And Minnesota has not kept up.
That is not acceptable.
This year, we must deliver.
Our telecommunications reform plan eliminates an entire chapter of state law and abolishes more than ten pages of outdated regulations.
And in addition, it creates an expedited process for resolving telecommunications related disputes between customers and providers.
It allows telephone companies to compete on a level playing field in " Minnesota. New competitors will bring choice and improved service to consumers currently served by a monopoly.
Let me give'you a couple of examples of how competition helps.
Fey Industries employs more than 200 people in Edgerton, Minnesota.
Until recently, the local phone company was charging them more than $1,500 per month for high speed service. When a competitive telephone company came to Edgerton, they offered to sell exactly the same service for $225 a month.
When the original company found out about that, they offered to cut the price to $500 a month. Fey Industries decided that the best option for them was to buy service from BOTH companies to make sure that they had backup service in case one line went down.
With competition in town, Fey Industries now has double the service at half the price!
On the other hand, in Glenwood Minnesota, one of their major employers, American Business Forms, has had to suffer through five cuts in its fiber optic cable in recent months. There is no competitor there to offer them backup service so when the fiber gets cut, American Business Forms is effectively shut

down and they lose thousands of dollars.
Our plan adds teeth to requirements that force monopoly providers to open up their networks to competitors.
Just ask the residents of Marshall or Worthington what happens when competition is allowed to thrive, rates decrease and service improves.
Just ask the people of Gilbert what can happen when a major employer like Delta Dental chooses to site a new facility with more than 100 good paying jobs because Gilbert has high speed telecommunications access and other communities do not.
Monopoly providers have no incentive to keep rates low, invest in advanced services, or provide the best quality services because they know consumers have no other choice.
And despite what some of the monopoly phone providers have been saying, my plan does not increase taxes.
What it does do is eliminate hidden taxes in our phone bills that subsidize monopoly telephone company profits.
The Ventura Administration's research shows that much of Greater Minnesota is being left behind when it comes to advanced telecommunications services.
Some of the smaller providers in rural Minnesota are making investments in their infrastructure and we applaud them, but this is not happening on a broad enough scale to give all Minnesotans access to this technology.
Our goal is simple.
Minnesota will make the transition from a noncompetitive regulatory environment to a consumer oriented telecommunications marketplace.
High quality, fairly priced voice, data, and video services must be available to every home and business in Minnesota.
If we are not successful in accomplishing this reform, this year, we will have, again, missed a great opportunity.
Let's work together to get it done. The people are counting on us.
And now, education.
Arguably our most important responsibility.
And for sure, our greatest challenge to reform. But reform we must.


We have a great history of education reform in this state but now is not a time to rest on our laurels.
We must meet the challenge of filling teacher vacancies in certain subject areas, including math and science.
We must meet the challenge of teacher compensation in general.
And we must meet the challenge of being accountable to the taxpayers for the billions we spend on education in Minnesota.
Therefore, increases in my budget for K through12 education spending will be limited and targeted.
My budget will include options that propose to facilitate alternative ways of paying teachers and alternative pathways to teaching.
This last biennium, with tripartisan support, we increased K through 12 spending by $1.3 billion dollars.
Still most local school districts would like much more. But I am skeptical because I believe that most districts have not shown taxpayers the benefit of the last budget increase.
I do know that some districts are working hard to focus more of their existing money on improving student learning.
It can be done.
From Mabel- Canton to Minneapolis to Minnetonka, teachers, school boards and administrators are having some healthy discussions about establishing priorities and finding new ways to do things with the same old money, and you know what?
The world is not crashing to a halt.
What I will recommend in my budget are ways to support new teachers in the classroom by supporting those districts that think and act outside of the box.
My budget will support those districts that provide mentoring support, and create new career pathways that help teachers stay in their chosen profession.
I will propose ways to support getting new teachers and non teachers into the classroom by loosening and fixing licensing requirements and compensation plans.
We all know that the least productive teacher gets the same pay as the most productive teacher. Obviously there is not a great cost benefit to this system, especially in a full employment economy.

I am proposing that when a teacher is a superior performer that teacher be paid accordingly.
It is a different world today and will be a much different world tomorrow. And in education, as in business, it is the tomorrow that we must prepare for.
Education is key. No question about it.
It is the foundation upon which our children will build their working careers. And it is the driving force for still more reform.
Minnesota's success in the new economy will depend upon our future workforce being prepared and our current workforce being re - educated.
About 16 months ago, I met the movers and shakers of Hutchinson, Minnesota.
What impressed me the most about that town was that their leader, Mayor Marlin Torgenson, had the right attitude.
When you called up the mayor and got his message recorder, you heard this Will Rogers quote:
"Even if you are on the right track, you will get run over if you just sit there."
I think that about sums up the workforce development challenge we are facing right now.
Let's start with the basics.
The most important asset we have in Minnesota is our human capital.
Our workforce will keep business in Minnesota, it will attract new business to Minnesota, and it will create vitality to maintain our superior standard of living.
In today's economy, workforce development is economic development.
Yes, we have a responsibility to create a favorable business climate with tax rates for business that are competitive and property taxes that are fair.
But our responsibility does not end there.
The state must approach education, workforce development and economic development with a single strategy.
That is why I am exploring a major reorganization among the two state agencies that are currently delivering workforce and economic development programs, the Department of Economic Security and the Department of Trade and Economic Development.
Later this month I will bring to you a proposal to more fully incorporate workforce and economic development.
My administration's proposal will consider the best of these areas and create new opportunities to take advantage of our commitment to this new principle.
The purpose of a reorganization is not cost savings. I expect this reform to be budget - neutral.
The primary purpose of a reorganization is to integrate economic and workforce development policy decision making.
Why?
Because the new economy demands it.
Another goal of the reorganization would be to provide a fresh perspective for aging programs that were created in an era of high unemployment, slow economic growth and few career opportunities.
My long term vision would include the state's entire adult training system. It would incorporate more fully adult basic education programs and our vocational/technical training institutions.
While these changes will produce a new way of doing things, the strategy to address workforce development does not end with these agency changes.
The workforce development strategy extends to every department across my Administration and includes a series of initiatives that I will propose to deal with teacher shortages, loan forgiveness programs for health care workers and employment opportunities for people with disabilities.
All this is so that Minnesota can compete with other states in this new technology driven economy.
But there is one last thing that I would like to emphasize.
I've already shared with you that to win in this economy we must have the best workforce. But let me add that in order to stay on top we must have a constant source of innovation.
We have this in the University of Minnesota.
But we must capture this innovation and bring it into Minnesota's economy.
It seems logical to me that the research and discovery that takes place at our university should stay in our marketplace and become Minnesota business opportunities.
To facilitate this process, in my budget this year, I will invest in technology commercialization that will be precise and targeted toward moving invention into our economy.
With the right cohesion between Minnesota's business community and the University of Minnesota, I believe we can make this success happen
When I started this speech I said it would be about reform.
And it is.
Bold, necessary and responsible reform.
You may have also noticed that these reforms have one thing in common.
They don't set us up to spend a lot of money.
Again, it doesn't matter what part of Minnesota I travel in, I can be in Thief River Falls, Slayton or Willmar, and generally come back to St. Paul with three messages:
The first message is usually, "send any excess tax collections back to the people in the form of a sales tax rebate."
So let's do the right thing and send it back.
Second, they almost always remind me that I am a "fiscal conservative" and promised in my campaign to limit government.
The third thing I usually hear is that "taxes are unfairly applied and are way too high. So when you have permanent growth in the economy that will allow you to cut taxes, do it."
And finally let me add a fourth that I am beginning to hear: "These economic times are great but remember they might not last.· Be cautious."
Let me give you an example of how my caution was not heeded last year.
Minnesota state government grew 16.3% last biennium and about 6% of that growth came in the second year's session that was supposed to be a capital bonding year.
This year state government is expected to grow another 6.5% even before you and I make any decisions this session.
That 6.5% is the estimated cost for programs that are already in law. The growth is a result of expanding state programs, and inflationary pressure for things like labor costs and health care.
I strongly believe that we need to assess what we're already doing with the projected $41.1 billion dollar budget for the next biennium before we consider spending a dollar more.
I instructed every one of my commissioners to thoroughly evaluate their existing budgets and reallocate resources away from unnecessary, irrelevant or redundant programs and toward higher priorities with clear, measurable outcomes.
As a result of this challenge on January 23 of this year I will deliver a biennial budget that will have very limited spending, be focused on achieving results and committed to delivering better and faster services with little more than existing resources.
Better and faster services with little more than existing resources.
Interesting.
Last year I spoke often of reforming government to make it better, faster and more accountable, all with fewer resources.
I suggested that we could do that with a unicameral legislature.
It didn't happen.
Instead, many of you argued that the problems in the legislature could be solved through changes in statute and legislative rule.
"You don't need to cut off your arm to fix a broken bone."
That's what I was told in a committee hearing last February.
I'm disappointed that the bicameral process effectively killed a bill giving the people an opportunity to weigh in on the structure of their government by sending it back to committee for consideration of a fiscal note.
I am, however, encouraged by your willingness to look at reforming the legislative process to provide for a more open, accountable and responsive government.
I heard from many of you last session about how you would like to reform the bicameral system.
Representative McElroy shared a proposal reforming the committee structure in both bodies to encourage joint decisionmaking on important issues to avoid the need for conference committees.

Other ideas were offered up in the various committee hearings.
I am challenging the legislature to make sure that these changes are considered and adopted in some form this session.
I challenge you to spend time reviewing and repealing obsolete laws and rules in the first few weeks of session before considering any new laws.
I challenge you to set real spending targets out in .the open and as early in the session as possible so that big decisions are not delayed until the final weeks of the legislative session.
I challenge you to give each legislator the opportunity to introduce a priority bill that will be guaranteed committee consideration and a floor vote. And,
I challenge you to open up the process by ensuring that committees do not meet after 10 p.m. and that meetings are announced at least one week in advance.
I realize that the legislature has made progress on reforming the legislative process over the last decade. But there is always room for improvement.
I trust that you will consider these suggestions as you adopt legislative rules, and I encourage you to do what's necessary to deliver on the promises ,made in the last session to reform the legislative process.
Implementing these changes will help ensure a more open, accountable and responsive government.
Of course, I still believe that a single house legislature would be the best way to fix the problems inherent in our two house system.
Rest assured, if the legislature fails to reform itself in this session, to paraphrase my good friend Arnold Schwartzenegger: "Unicameral will be back."
Another reform that I will propose is having only a single legislative session in the biennium.
I hope that you will also join me in advancing a Single Session every two years.
The current system was adopted by constitutional amendment in 1972 to allow for more thoughtful consideration of important policy and budgetary matters, avoid the end of session logjams, and eliminate the need for expensive special seSSIOns.
This probably sounded like pretty good reform back then. However, when reform clearly doesn't work I think we should have the courage to recognize it.

In fact, since we went to two sessions, we've seen more bills introduced, more laws passed, longer sessions, legislative logjams and more permanent growth in state spending.
The House and Senate introduced a total of 8,016 bills in the 1999 - 2000 biennium. Up 45% from just ten years ago.
The 1999 - 2000 Legislature, for the first time in history, passed more laws in the second year of the biennium than in the first year.
We still experience the end of session logjams as the legislature meets around the clock to conclude its business before the constitutional deadline.
In the 2000 session the legislature met 51 legislative days over 15 weeks. This is up from 38 legislative days in 10.5 weeks in 1990.
It's quite clear that this is not what was originally intended when the people passed the constitutional amendment allowing for flexible sessions.
Remember the 16.3% increase in spending I spoke about earlier?
That number grew from 12% in 1999 because the legislature came back in the 2000 legislative session and increased spending even more.
The second year of the biennium is supposed to be only about capital bonding. But it also ended up being about more permanent spending.
And that alone may be the best reason for moving back to a single session.
I see no reason why we can't complete the people's business with one legislative session every other year.
I also believe that a single session will focus both the executive and legislative branches more on issues that are important to the people and less on election year politics.
I support a constitutional amendment to return to a single legislative session every two years.
But even without an amendment, I have instructed my staff to work with commissioners to develop a capital budget for your consideration this session and stand ready to adjourn sine die this spring.
But before you adjourn, there is another important concern that we must address:
campaign finance reform.
This issue was overshadowed by presidential politics in the weeks following the 2000 elections, but I believe that it is critical to maintaining the integrity of our election process and re- engaging citizens in their government.
While Minnesota is doing a lot of things right, I encourage the legislature to follow through on campaign finance reforms that will address some of the flaws in our system.
My Administration's goals for campaign finance reform are:
Closing the soft money loophole.
Giving candidates the public money when they need it.
Providing better citizen access to campaign finance information on the web.
Many agree that soft money channeled through political parties to support individual campaigns is a huge problem, and it played an even more prominent role in the 2000 elections than in previous election cycles.
Much of this money is laundered through national political parties and congressional committees and we've seen our share of these "independent expenditures" in Minnesota.
While parties and advocacy groups should certainly have the opportunity to express their views on candidates' policy records, the current barrage Qf negative and misleading ads and mailings in the final week or two of the election is unfair to the candidates and to the people they seek to represent.
I believe that political parties and party caucuses should agree to limit their independent expenditures as a condition of receiving public money, and I encourage the Minnesota Legislature to pass a bill that will close this gaping loophole in Minnesota's law.
However, while reining in soft money will help to level the playing field, we must also give candidates public money when they really need it.
In Minnesota, legislative and constitutional officer candidates are currently given public funds following the general election if they receive a certain percentage of the total vote in that election. This financing mechanism forces many candidates to take out loans to cover campaign expenses until after the election.
This is particularly unfair to challengers since many incumbents have built up a war chest over several election cycles.
Some candidates, particularly challengers, have difficulty securing the loan even if they demonstrate a certain level of support.
As a candidate for governor, 22 banks turned me down before I was able to find one that would give me a loan.
I support changing the timing of these direct payments to candidates.
Minnesota candidates who sign a spending limit agreement, raise the appropriate level of qualifying contributions, and have the nomination of a major political party should receive their public subsidies immediately after the primary election.
This proposal will help level the playing field by putting viable challengers in a position to run competitive campaigns.
It's also time for state campaign finance information to be available online to provide easy and timely citizen access to this information.
Campaign expenditures and contributions are public information. But in many states, including Minnesota, this data is not available on the Internet.
This proposal will help bring government back to the people by giving them the tools and information they need to made good decisions about who they want representing them.
By accomplishing these goals, we will help ensure that any person interested in elected office can run a competitive campaign and be judged on the issues rather than the size of his or her pocketbook.
If we hope to reengage individual citizens in our political process, we must limit the financial influence of special interests in campaigns and level the playing field between challengers and incumbents.
I hope that you'll join me in sharing the responsibility for reforming our campaign finance system.
And so, to the people of this great state and to the elected leaders in this room, I submit this very ambitious agenda.
I promised the people that I would have the courage to challenge the status quo and shake up the system.
I believe that this agenda fulfills that promise, and I believe it does it in a very responsible manner.
As the business of this body begins, we can choose to debate these bold reforms that are so important to the people of this state, or we can choose to focus on the personal, the political and the petty.
My commissioners, my staff and I worked very hard to develop these important reforms.

Let us move forward to debate them.
Thank you.Good evening-I'm speaking to you from the Governor's Residence in St. PauL ..
This past year the longest lasting economic expansion in United States history came to an end. For years we had been warned thatwhat goes up must come down-and indeed it did.
Last March the country quietly slipped into a recession. However, while there was little notice at the time, it all came crashing home on September 11, 2001.
But as I said after the terrorist attacks, no one, not Osama Bin Laden, nor any of his terrorists pan take away our resilience.
When 35,000 of you stood in the rain on the capitol grounds on Sunday, September 16, it was clear that Minnesotans would not forget, and together we will preserve our freedom and rebuild our economy.
And so tonight, 1 want to talk to you about the challenges the recession brings to the state of Minnesota.

Forty-four states, including Minnesota, are facing budget deficits.
The fact is, people in Minnesota and across the country are getting laid off from their jobs and when that happens families cut back,they buy less,they travel less and so, they pay less taxes.
Over two years, Minnesota will collect almost $2 billion dollars less in taxes and fees than we thought.
And just as important, in all the years after that, revenues will be about $1.2 billion dollars less than we have committed to spend.
Even though some economists are saying that the economy is beginning to improve, the impact of the recession, and. the lost revenue, will always be with us. Unless we bring revenue and spending back into balance we will face continuing budget shortfalls into the future.
As your elected representatives we have a duty not to just solve the short-run problem,
but to fac the tough choices required for a permanent budget solution.
The governor and the legislature are required by law to rework the budget and make sure that by the end of this current cycle we have a balanced budget.


That's our legal obligation. But some will want to stop there, put off the tough decisions until after their elections and hope for the best.
I won't stand for that.
As I promised you when I was elected I have continued my effort to find an appropriate balance between the amount of money the state collects in taxes and the high level of services that Minnesota citizens have come to expect.
This, of course, is always a dilemma.
Clearly, Minnesota taxpayers have been frustrated as our state continued to rank as one of the most highly taxed in the nation.
Over the past three years my administration has carefully managed our resources to bring down your property taxes, your income taxes, many business taxes and the cost of your car license tabs.
We have created a more fair tax environment that has provided significant property tax reductions in all property classifications and also succeeded in giving citizens more direct control over the amount of property tax they pay.
However, in addition to lowering taxes,we have also worked hard to make sure that the taxes you do pay bring the most value possible.
When I visit schools I often tell students that the state does not manufacture dollars in the basement of the capitoL Every dollar that we get sent to us comes from the fruits of someone's labor.
I tell the students that when a worker spends an entire day digging a hole and gets a paycheck of one hundred dollars, the government is going to take about thirty-five dollars of that one hundred to benefit people who didn't have anything to do with digging that hole.
I use this example to illustrate why I am so focused on accountability and results.
I use it to emphasize how important it is to make sure that we are not wasting the fruits of that ditch digger's hard labor.
Ten years ago the state of Minnesota's two-year budget was $13.6 billion dollars. In the current ten-year budget cycle we will spend almost $28 billion dollars on state provided servIces.
That's big government.


We build and maintain roads, bridges, prisons and schools.

We educate our children, we care for our elderly and we protect the public's safety.

We do all these things and much more.

But unfortunately, as you saw on the previous chart, every year that we do more, it will cost you more in taxes.

It is my belief that when we are facing a two billion dollar budget deficit we should concentrate on what is necessary and not necessarily what's nice.

And so tonight I would like to talk to you about how we might tackle this budget shortfall.

Basically, we have three options:

Cut spending,

Raise taxes, or

We could try to use election year budget gimmicks.

The first two options are legitimate options. The third is just not responsible.

But whatever we do, we need to do it quickly.

We are already six months into our two-year budget and every day that passes without

making adjustments means there will be less money in the bank to cushion the blow of

budget cutting.

With that in mind, three months ago I began preparing for the worst, and asked my staff and commissioners to begin working on a budget reduction plan that would focus on eliminating programs rather than just cutting across the board.

When considering cuts, I instructed them that everything should be on the table.

In this process there should be no sacred cows.

In addition, I met with legislative leaders and urged them to work together with us to develop a plan that could be implemented early this year.

Clearly, under no circumstances will I tolerate this process dragging on and on, getting bogged down in political turfwars and end up spending even more of your hard earned tax dollars on special legislative sessions.


Now is the time to put aside election year politics and act quickly on what is in the best interests of the people.
The time to fix this problem is now and not in April, Mayor June during a special session.
And when I say fix I don't mean a political quick fix that would simply postpone the
problem and leave it for another year. That's the election year budget gimmick approach that I said earlier is not an option.
Sure, I could take the politically safe approach and use accounting gimmicks to delay making tough decisions, choose not to run again and ride off into the sunset and leave another governor and the taxpayers to deal with the mess.
But I won't do that.
After I was elected I pledged that I would leave the budget in as good a shape as it was when I took over. Whether I leave this job this year or five years from now I will not go back on that promise.
Minnesota leaders have worked hard to gain the respect of Wall Street, and along with only ten other states, we have obtained the highest credit rating in the nation. That tripleA credit rating allows us to borrow money to finance building projects at the lowest interest rare available and consequently save millions of dollars in interest payments.
If we try to solve this budget problem with quick fix accounting gimmicks or borrowing on future revenue sources, you can be sure that Wall Street will be watching and our credit rating will suffer.
I assure you that I will not allow our triple-A credit rating to be put in jeopardy.
And so now we must ask, how do we solve this problem?
First of all, we are fortunate that we did plan well.
Last year, we worked. with the legislature.and provided a beefed up reserve fund of $653 million dollars. We left $235 million dollars in the budget that we didn't spend and provided $350 million cash flow account.
But it is im-portant to understand that while these funds help us in the short term, they will soon be gone .and not available for the long term. This money helps, but only to give us a little time to make the real tough decisions.
Likewise, some argue that if we had not given rebates we could have avoided this problem, but the truth is the rebate money was a one-time surplus that would not have solved the-long-term problem of reduced revenues as a result of a national economic recession.
Remember, if the rebate dollars had been used for new spending or permanent tax cuts, our budget problem would be even worse.
When I hear that rebate argument, I simply point out that if the rebates were the problem, why do other states most of whom didn't give rebates-now have budget shortfalls?
And so the answer to what we do is obvious: First, we must cut our expenses.
But as I said that will not be easy.
Consider this:
Of the entire $28 billion dollat: general fund budget, only five budget areas consume 85% of it.

As you can see on the chart the five are:
K-12 Education ,
Higher Education,
State aid sent to local governments,
Health Care, and
Human Services.

Even more revealing is that if you combine K-12 education and Higher Education, the two make up over 50% of the budget.
Another tough example is health care. After education, it is the largest area of state spending, and at 29% growth from the last biennium, it is the fastest growing spending item in the budget.
Remember, the more we spend, the more fruits of the ditch digger's labor must go to the government. I warned you that this isn't going to be easy.
For example, lets look again at the big five budget areas.

Notice that a huge part of the state's budget is given to cities and counties. Because one purpose of these payments to local governments is to hold down property taxes, some might question if it's working.
It is a substantial amount of money and may very well have to be a part of the overall budget solution. However, if some reduction of aid to cities and counties does become a reality, I would expect them to use their reserves, cut costs and reduce services.
Only as a last resort should local property taxes be raised.
Of course, after considering how difficult it may be to cut spending, I fully expect some citizens may lean toward raising taxes.
But as I said earlier, I am not looking for an easy way out. While I am not ruling out any option, I want to cut spending first, and I will adamantly oppose any undoing of the major tax reforms and accountability measures we passed last year.
However, in fairness, I have said that every legitimate option should be on the table and therefore we should talk about taxes that could be raised to avoid even bigger spending cuts.
For example, some people have suggested increasing the gas tax.
Likewise others have suggested raising the tax on cigarettes, extending the sales tax to clothing or re-visiting my proposal to lower the sales tax but extend it to some services.
These are just some of the taxes you will hear about.
We will work with you, legislators and economic experts not only to find every dollar but also to ensure that every dollar we find is used to its greatest value.
In that effort, one week from today I will present to you, and the legislature, a budget-
balancing plan.
My expectation is that the people and the legislature will review and debate the plan and be prepared to act on the plan in the first week of the session that begins on January 29th.
If, after the first week of the session., the legislature is not ready to begin taking action, I assure you that I will not stand by and watch our state's fiscal integrity be dragged into a political quagmire.
At the appropriate time, I will begin to use my executive powers to begin cutting our expenses and avoid a budget deficit made worse by inaction.

It is absolutely imperative that the executive and legislative branches work together by acting in the best interests of our taxpayers and not politicize this process.
We will all have to accept some sacrifice, but we are not going to tum our backs on the important things that we do.
We have a workforce that is talented and dedicated to the job that must be done.
We understand the added responsibility that the war brings to our mission and we will not sacrifice your safety.
We understand that you expect the state to continue to invest in and protect the state's infrastructure and we will.
And finally, I hope you will understand that while tonight I chose to emphasize the most important challenge before us, there are things going on in our state that we can all be proud of.
Our state -- and many of its cities -- are often cited as the best place to do high tech business, the best place to raise a family, and one of the healthiest states in the nation.
We must be doing something right.
The terrorist attack on our country and a national economic recession are having a tremendous effect on the state of our state. But be assured, we will not bow to forces of evil nor Will we shrink in the face of economic hard times.
Thank you for listening and watching. Good night and have a happy new year.Distinguished guests, distinguished members of the Legislature, thanks for the opportunity to report to you and the good people of Minnesota on the condition of our State. Our State is awesome. It remains one of the best in the country. But, as Bob Dylan wrote, "The times they are a changin'." We're in a new kind of war - started by sucker-punching cowards. The battle's here, on our shores, and it undermines our sense of security. We're in a new kind of economy. Capital investments, ideas and data are now flung around the world with a click of a mouse. And, we've got a new kind of state budget: it's terrible. Our freeways are clogged. Moms and dads are always in a time vice - between work and family. Our schools seem to be in constant crisis. Health care costs are eating our paychecks and government budgets alive. Our prisons are overflowing. Big parts of rural Minnesota are being left behind. Our beautiful Minnesota environment is under increasing stress. And, we've got more people in need and not enough resources to help them. And the beat goes on. These challenges are not the result of a lack of caring or lack of government spending. This state's spending doubled in just the last ten years. We're one of the highest taxed, highest spending states in the nation. Yet, even with government spending more and more and more, our momentum and quality of life have stalled out. We're in a financial crisis - the likes of which Minnesota has never seen. The largest budget deficit in the history of the State - times two or three - is staring us in the face. It's huge. It's mean. It's ugly. It's the Incredible Hulk of budget deficits. And it could get worse. A prolonged war with Iraq, an economic downturn or another major act of terrorism will worsen the deficit. We need to come together, as leaders and as Minnesotans, on a plan to cut the Goliath down to size and then build a brighter future. The Minnesota our parents and grandparents knew is a fond memory for many of us. But we can't take the same path as the generations that preceded us - it doesn't exist anymore. We need to reinvent Minnesota for our children and grandchildren. We can still rely on our great Minnesota principles and values as our compass. But we need to lead boldly and chart our own course to a new "Good Life in Minnesota." As governor, that's what I am going to do. 


As President Bush reminded us after the Columbia tragedy, great endeavors are never without great risk.
These days demand great courage and sacrifice from us all. This crisis will be only the most recent chapter in Minnesota's history of courage.
Last week at Camp Ripley and this week at the Marine Corps Reserve Center in Minneapolis, I had the privilege of thanking and helping to send off more brave men and women leaving their families to serve our country in the war on terror.
Many will be gone for a year or more. Many leave behind confused and distraught young children. I saw a heartbroken, sobbing four year old desperately clinging to the knee of her daddy, pleading with him not go. I tried to tell her that her daddy was a hero; that he was keeping us all safe; and that we loved him, too.
They go because it's their duty. They go because they understand commitment to principle. They go because they understand the need to sacrifice in times of crisis and peril.
Minnesotans have courage.
Today we have two very special guests with us. They're Harold "Snuff" Kervers and Alf Larson. They're survivors of the Bataan Death March, where 16,000 U.S. and Filipino soldiers died as they were forced to march without food and water to a Japanese prison camp. It was one of the most horrific chapters of the Second World War.
I met these patriots recently at a reception in honor of Alf's service to our country. One of Alf's friends heard about his story only after Alf reluctantly shared it in his eighties - after keeping it to himself for most of his life.
Minnesotans have courage.
They understand commitment to principle and the need to sacrifice in times of crisis. Help me thank these two remarkable Minnesotans.
If we go back 140 years, there occurred one of the greatest moments in Minnesota's history of courage.
On the very day Fort Sumter was fired upon and the Civil War began, our second governor, Alexander Ramsey, happened to be in Washington D.C. When he heard the news, he went immediately to the White House and pledged Minnesota's militia to President Lincoln. That militia was the first state unit committed to the war effort for the Union - the Minnesota 1st Voluntary Infantry Division - or the "Minnesota 1st" as they became known.
Just a short time later, the unit played perhaps the pivotal role of the entire war during the Battle of Gettysburg.
During the battle, a force of a thousand Confederate soldiers charged the middle of the Union army's lines in an effort to split them in two. Union General Hancock ordered Minnesota's unit to charge out and meet the attack - even though they were outnumbered 20 to 1.
He said this later about Minnesota's heroes:
"I ordered the men to charge because I saw I must gain five minutes time. Reinforcements were coming on the run, but I knew before they could reach the threatened point, the Confederates, unless checked, would seize the position. The charge was necessary. I was glad to find such a gallant body of men willing to make the terrible sacrifice."
Eighty-two percent of the Minnesota 1st fell in those five minutes, the largest percentage loss of life of ANY unit during ANY engagement of the war. Had General Lee succeeded in that charge and that battle, the tide of the war could have turned. In their five minutes of courage and ultimate sacrifice, the Minnesota 1st changed the course of history and this nation.
Courage and sacrifice is not limited to those in uniform.
It's on display in our homes, neighborhoods, charities, places of worship, and businesses every day and in every town across this Great State.
Yes. Minnesotans have courage.
We understand commitment to principle and the need to sacrifice in times of crisis.
And we need that now. We have our duty to perform. Let's get at it.


Our work starts with solving the State's budget crisis. It's job one, two, three and maybe four.
The deficit we face is caused by spending too much, not by taxing too little.
The revenues coming into the State are projected to grow by 6.6 percent, which is a normal level in Minnesota's modern history. What's out of control is our government spending. Unless we change things, our state budget is expected to grow by 14.4 percent during the upcoming biennium.
I don't know many Minnesotans whose paychecks are growing by 14.4 percent.
This isn't brain surgery, folks. The State is simply spending more than it is taking in. And now we need to do what any Minnesota family who faces a financial challenge would do - sit down together at the kitchen table and figure it out.
Families can't raise taxes to get out of a jam -- and we won't either.
People will say reductions in funding for government programs are an intolerable sacrifice or that we're sending our state back to the Stone Age.
What they won't tell you is that the budget we'll be submitting will actually increase the overall level of state government spending and that this will be the largest budget in Minnesota history.
And, they won't tell you that even after the cuts, we'll remain one of the biggest government spending states in the nation.
When the protests come, and they'll come loudly and often, I hope you'll help me share this message:
We're at war. Our economy is in deep trouble. Thousands and thousands of our fellow Minnesotans have lost their jobs. The sacrifices we'll be asking government to make are no different than the sacrifices families, businesses, workers and all organizations across this State are already making every single day.
And one more thing: the difficulties we face and the cuts we'll be making are nothing -- they are nothing -- compared to the sacrifices made by the generations before us or the sacrifices the men and women of our armed forces are making today.
We spent our way into this crisis. We're not going to tax our way out of it.
For some, that's an outrageous position. The people of Minnesota don't think so. As I travel around this great state, people agree that we shouldn't raise taxes.
Solving our budget deficit without raising taxes should not be a partisan issue.
Look to our east. The Governors of Wisconsin and Michigan -- who are Democrats -- have said they will not raise taxes. They have joined with their legislative leaders to make a bipartisan commitment to solve their deficits without new taxes.
We should have a united front against the deficit in Minnesota. Today, I'm asking legislators from both parties to join with me and most Minnesotans to protect hardworking Minnesota families from having government take even more from their paychecks.

Our budget and our agenda is not just about balancing the books. It'll also be about re-tooling, reforming and improving government so we reinvigorate our quality of life. I'm not interested in managing government. I want to change it.
Behind me is a portrait of Abraham Lincoln. When he took office, he set two main goals. First, preserve the Union. And second, build the transcontinental railroad.
Now, the fans of the Northstar Commuter rail project shouldn't get overly excited about this reference. The point here is much broader.
Facing the greatest crisis in this nation's history, Lincoln knew securing the present was not enough. He had a vision and agenda for building the future beyond the immediate crisis.

We can't just solve the budget crisis. We also need to get about the business of re-building Minnesota's future.
The good news is that if we make the tough calls now, our budget situation is going to come around within three years. Better days will come if - if - we lead now.
And while we don't have much new money to spend, we do have the power to create new and much more effective ways to spend the money we do have.

The education of our children and grandchildren is one of our highest duties.
It wasn't that long ago that Minnesota was the epicenter of innovation in education. If something big and good was happening in education reform, it was happening here.
We still have a great education system, but we've become complacent and we're treading water. We need to reclaim our place as the best education innovators in the country.
Here's what we need to do to get started:
1. Get back to the core mission.
The main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing. Educating children and improving student learning is the main thing. Not "feel good" curriculum. Not focusing on attitudes instead of academics. We're going to start this effort to refocus by renaming the Department of Children, Families and Learning the Minnesota Department of Education.
2. School accountability begins with parents.
Parents need to be more accountable. Parents must do their part. Minnesota moms and dads, we need to make sure our children get a good night's rest before school, and come to school fed and ready to learn.
When they're at school, children need to behave and it's the parent's job to help ensure behavioral problems don't continue. And when our children return home, both they and their parents need to understand that homework and tutoring by parents is more important than American Idol, WWE, DVD's or getting to the next level on the Grand Theft Auto video game.
As working parents with two young children, Mary and I know how challenging this can be. The First Lady, who is with us here today, is an extraordinary wife and mom and our family is so grateful for her.
For the parents who can't or won't answer this call, we need to find mentors, tutors and others who will.
3. The Profile of Learning needs to be abolished and replaced with something better.
Minnesota started America down the path of uniform standards for schools. But we've veered badly off track.
Our children deserve nation-leading academic standards that are clear, rigorous and focused on what students need to know. And I trust teachers to know how to help students reach those standards.
4. We need a new approach to educating our neediest children.
As good as our schools have been, we're leaving too many children behind. And the sad reality is, they tend to be poor, disabled, or children of color.
I will not stand by and allow another generation of disadvantaged children to be cast aside.
In some of our highest spending school districts, less than 1/2 the students graduate, and many who do need remedial education. That's not good enough. For these children, we need to be more creative.
My administration is committed to giving the parents of these children more options. Who is against giving poor, failing or disabled children more opportunities - and why would you be?

5. Reward great teachers.
The best and brightest students in the world need the best and brightest teachers in the world. That means paying good teachers more for excellent teaching. We need to move towards performance pay plans for school staff.
6. Create a school funding formula that is fair and understandable.
The current school funding formula is broken and too complicated.
In the coming weeks, we'll name a panel of school finance experts and interested citizens to begin the process of redesigning our school funding formula. After receiving their recommendations, we'll ask the Legislature to authorize demonstration projects that will allow a dozen districts to try out the new ways of funding schools. Whatever works best should be available to districts statewide.
Better schools are the ticket to opportunity and a better quality of life for future Minnesotans.

And so is a job.
We're the place that invented toasters, thermostats, water-skis and Spam. We heal the world, feed the world and sell the world pacemakers. We dug the iron ore than won two world wars. But our economy is in trouble.
We've lost 38,000 manufacturing jobs in the last four years. That's nearly all of the manufacturing jobs we gained during the entire decade of the 1990's. We're hemorrhaging the types of jobs where average Minnesotans can still make a good wage and have decent benefits.
We need a full range of job opportunities in Minnesota to sustain the quality of life for everybody. I'm sick and tired of stimulating the economies of places like Wisconsin and South Dakota with our jobs.
Here's what we need to do:
1. Do no further harm.
Taxes chew up the bottom line of job creators. We can't make a bad situation worse.
2. Create JOB Zones.
Today, there's an acute shortage of good paying jobs in Greater Minnesota.
From East Grand Forks to Hibbing to Luverne to Spring Grove, there are communities and families and small businesses that need a reason to hope - and a chance to grow jobs. Today I'm calling on the Legislature to enact my plan for JOB Zones to provide an economic adrenaline boost to the most economically challenged areas of the state.
3. Invest at home.
The State Board of Investment should invest more in Minnesota companies. Many states already have gone down this path. It's resulted in more investment and jobs in their states.
4. Build on our strengths.
It's easier to ride a wave than to create one.
When it comes to future job growth, our state's economic health hinges on human health. We're a world leader in cutting edge medical technologies. Genomics, medical devices and biotechnology offer the promise of a longer life and the opportunity for more good jobs in Minnesota.
We need to rekindle the entrepreneurial spirit of Minnesota's colleges and universities to make our state a global leader in this rapidly emerging industry.
I will lead efforts to bring the Mayo Clinic and the University of Minnesota together to make two of the nation's premier providers strong partners in developing the treatments, devices and medicines that will revolutionize medical care within a decade.

It will also be a big boost to our economy.
5. Provide greater incentives for investments in new Minnesota businesses.
Once we get our heads above water with the budget, we should provide greater incentives for venture capital investment in new Minnesota companies. To build jobs, we need to be more friendly to job-creators and investment- makers or every one of us will pay the price. We need to stop the things that drive jobs away and start doing more of the things that bring jobs here to stay.

A great education and a good job don't mean much if we're not safe.
The safety of our citizens is government's first duty. We're in a global war against terrorism, and we need to keep our guard up by taking several actions:
1. Keep track of foreign visitors by putting their visa expiration dates right on their drivers licenses.
We shouldn't give a four-year driver's license - Minnesota's most important identity document - to people who may only legally be in this country for a few weeks. This common sense legislation passed the House with a majority of Republicans and Democrats voting for it. Today, I'm calling on the Senate to quickly embrace this important prevention tool that our law enforcement community has endorsed.
2. Help authorities communicate in time of crisis.
The men and women who risk their lives responding to an emergency need to be able to talk to each other. If disaster strikes here, many of the first responders have radios that don't allow them to talk to each other. This is especially true in Greater Minnesota. It's a problem that will cost lives in the event of a real emergency.
I will use federal terrorism dollars to accelerate Minnesota's efforts to allow First Responders to communicate.
3. Share information with local and federal authorities.
One of the lessons of September 11th was that the failure of agencies to share information made us more vulnerable. We won't repeat that mistake in Minnesota. One of our priorities will be to complete the work of linking our criminal justice systems to protect the lives of Minnesotans.
4. Serve crime victims better.
Victims of crime are now poorly served by uncoordinated programs that were designed to help them. We're going to pull together crime victim and anti-violence efforts into a new Office of Justice Programs to provide a seamless system of services.

In addition to keeping people safe, we need to improve the ability of Minnesotans to travel.
We need to change the culture and the approach to building Minnesota's transportation infrastructure. Our projects take too long, cost too much, and don't move enough people and goods from point A to Point B. This burdens our economy and compromises our quality of life.
MNDOT needs a shake up, and I don't know a better shaker than Lieutenant Governor Carol Molnau. She'll find waste and end it. She'll locate red tape and cut it. She'll find money to save and reinvest it.
We will move our transportation system forward.

Health care is at the same time Minnesota's costliest problem and its greatest opportunity for change. Rising health care costs are fueling a big part of our budget deficit and they're squeezing the budgets of workers, employers, and families in a very painful way. If any state can solve this problem, it's Minnesota.
Former U.S. Senator Dave Durenberger has agreed to lead a Blue Ribbon Task Force of Minnesotans to help us chart a course for the future of health and health care in Minnesota. This task force will provide Minnesotans with a long range cost control strategy to make health care more affordable. I expect this task force to finish its work within the next eight months.

With Senator Durenburger's leadership, I'm confident this effort will succeed.
Kids, jobs, public safety, transportation and health. Some will ask if we can afford to move forward with these new initiatives. We can't afford not to.

There's a story I've heard about John F. Kennedy.
In 1961, President Kennedy said: "...this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the moon, and return him safely to the earth."
The story goes, he was touring the Space Center in Florida a short time later. At one point during the tour, the President visited with a janitor. The young president said to the man, "Well, sir, what do you do here at the Space Center?" Without hesitating, the man answered, "I'm putting a man on the moon by the end of this decade, Mr. President."
Vision is a powerful thing. It motivates people because it connects their individual contribution, however small, to a great and noble purpose.
Today I want to issue a call to citizenship and service to every Minnesotan who hears my voice. Minnesota needs you -- now.
I got a letter recently from Phyllis Bakke of Northfield, who has joined us today.
Without commenting on her age, let me just say she's seen many governors come and go in her lifetime. She wrote to encourage me. When she read about the deficit, she did a simple thing. She sent me a dollar. This dollar.
I'm sure she's sent a lot of dollars to the Minnesota Treasury during her life. But she wanted me to know, and wants us all to know, she's going the extra mile for the state she loves. I'm going to keep Phyllis' dollar to remind me that addressing a meaningful challenge begins with one small step. And you know what Phyllis? When we've met the challenge and solved this crisis, I'm going to give you your dollar back.
Thank you for your Minnesota spirit of giving and sacrifice.
In a time so dominated by big government, big business, big labor and big media, perhaps we have lost our understanding of the role citizens can play.
The Minnesota Time magazine celebrated three decades ago was not the product of politicians, CEOs or talk radio. It was created by citizens who reinvented health care, education, and community.
As Minnesota approaches our 150th Birthday, we need to rediscover that civic service that made us great.
Perhaps we've all become too comfortable, too entitled, too quick to rely on government and too slow to take responsibility ourselves. We face an unprecedented global and financial crisis. Perhaps that is the privilege of our problem: to hear our own call to arms, our own call to service, our own call to sacrifice and our own call to leadership.
I ask you to serve wherever your conscience directs and your circumstances permit.
Shut off the TV and the computer and find somebody who needs your attention.
Learn about another culture and get to know and trust someone different than you.
Buy something on East Lake Street rather than on EBay.
Instead of going to a "feel good" movie, do something good and feel the real thing.
I want to make a special call to the citizenship of those who have chosen the serving professions. The teachers, nurses and doctors. The ministers, social workers, tutors, mentors, and public employees. Thanks for what you do.
We need you to help solve this challenge. For now, the answer can't be more money. But you can help a great deal because I know you have ideas on how to reform your professions from the inside out and how to revolutionize the way we heal, teach and build character. We need you and ask for your help.

One of my first visits after the election was to the Department of Public Safety. A supervisor there pulled me aside and said, "Governor: the key is not doing more with less. It's doing the right things well." That was Brian Lamb, my new Commissioner of Administration. He summed up what must become our common passion and vision.
And as Minnesotans have done throughout our history, we should seek strength beyond ourselves.
Isaiah wrote:
"Even youths grow tired and weary, and young men stumble and fall; but those who hope in God will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint."
In that spirit and hope, and in the great heritage of service and sacrifice that is Minnesota, let us walk together. Then let us run. And one day soon, even soar.
May God bless you and may God continue to bless the great State of Minnesota."Why do we live here in Minnesota?" It's been 25 below, it seems like we only see the sun for a few hours during winter days, and we spend a lot of time shoveling snow. There are other places to live. Why do we live here?
That's the question I've been asking Minnesotans lately, and I've heard many different answers.
Some people told me they love being able to go "up north, to the cabin." Others said they love our great outdoors. Good schools. Less crime than other places. The value of being near family. Others say they love the change of seasons and all the fun things to do... like ice fishing.
I did hear a common theme from everyone: There's a special Minnesota spirit, and that's the reason we love our state.
Perhaps the greatest examples of our Minnesota spirit are the brave Minnesotans who serve in the United States Military.
Some of these men and women have made the ultimate sacrifice.
Seated in the gallery are Caroline and Larry Erickson and Karen and Arland Panchot, whose sons Brian Hellerman and Dale Panchot were two Minnesota soldiers who gave their lives in Iraq. Two other Minnesota soldiers, Ed Herrgott and Patrick Dorff, also lost their lives in combat in Iraq. While so very proud of their sons, their loss pains their families deeply. To the families: Your sons' sacrifices helped make this world a better place. We're grateful to them and to all the men and women who serve. Please join me in expressing our appreciation for these brave Minnesotans.

In the last couple years, we've been tested by war, recession, layoffs, terrorism and budget deficits. But I'm here to tell you, the spirit of Minnesota is strong and so is the state of our state.
We have reason to be optimistic.
A year ago, I stood here and said Minnesota government was 4.5 billion dollars in the hole. It was devastating news.
One year later, what story does Minnesota's checkbook tell?
When the budget forecast comes out later this month, I expect it to say we've made about 4 billion dollars worth of progress towards balance, and that we've built 600 million in reserves.
And we did it without raising taxes!
We're not out of the woods yet. We still have some deficit yet to fix now and in the future. But we've made tremendous progress.
The budget was not all we did this past year.
We finally repealed the convoluted Profile of Learning! And, we're replacing it with rigorous, high-quality learning standards.
Even with a mammoth deficit, we maintained per-pupil funding for core K-12 classroom functions.
With a record number of Minnesotans overseas defending that flag and what it represents, we reinstituted the Pledge of Allegiance in our schools. It's high time we did.
We established Job Opportunity Building Zones to bring jobs and growth back to rural Minnesota.
We put the visa expiration dates of foreign visitors right on their Minnesota driver's licenses to help law enforcement fight terrorism.

We positioned Minnesota to become a world leader in the coming bioscience revolution.
We jump-started road and bridge construction with the largest infusion of funding in our history.
We once again made work the focus of welfare reform.
We promoted justice and fairness by enacting lawsuit reform.
We enhanced the environmental protection of our land, air and water, including reaching a one billion dollar agreement to clean up old coal plants. The agreement will yield the most significant reduction in emissions since the federal Clean Air Act.
And remember, we did all this without raising taxes!
But as we contend for Minnesota's share of the future, we've not yet begun to fight.
The future is coming at us faster than it ever has. It's a tidal wave of change. If we don't get on top of it and ride it, it will drown us. We need to prepare Minnesota to take advantage of the change that's coming. The global economy is impacting our Minnesota economy with all the subtlety of a deploying airbag.
My passion as Governor is this: I want Minnesota to contend for its share of the future right now, and I want Minnesota to face its challenges and win.
To do that, we'll need to be at the top of our game. We're not going to carry the day on the size of our population and certainly not because of our weather.

We do need to be more competitive on things like taxes, regulations and health insurance costs, but we're never going to be a "bargain basement" state that can low-ball China or Mexico or even lots of other states on price. That's not our tradition in Minnesota, it's not our culture and it's not our future.
But that means to compete, we need to be quicker, faster, smarter, more energetic, more creative, more nimble, and more strategic than other states and our international competitors.
I'm excited about the challenge, and hope you are too. I want to develop every option, push every button, and explore every idea I can to get us another inch closer to being great.
Some think we can secure Minnesota's future just by adding more money to our past approaches.
Others think that all we need to do is cut taxes, regulations, and other government demands.
Government is not the answer and government is not the problem. We need to make government both leaner and more effective, and we can do both. To accomplish that, we need to do things differently.
At another time like this, FDR said:
"The country needs... the country demands bold, persistent experimentation. It is common sense to take a method and try it. If it fails, admit it frankly and move on. But above all, try something."
For starters, we need to forge a new spirit of unity and fair play in this place. We have huge challenges ahead us. We've got no energy to waste playing political splat ball.
There are three things on which we can all agree.

First, Minnesota is the most fertile place in America, not just for crops, but for ideas.
Second, Minnesota government lost its leadership edge a while ago, and we need to get it back. Good enough, isn't. We need more energy, vision and willingness to take risks.
And third, innovation and reform are the heart of who we are, the core of the Minnesota spirit.
The people in Two Harbors who invented sandpaper didn't know they were creating 3M. The people in Rochester who set up a new kind of hospital didn't know they were creating the Mayo Clinic. And I'm sure Mr. and Mrs. Hartman had no idea what they were doing when they created Sid.
Change creates new possibilities, new futures that never existed before.
The first big thing we should do is make sure no future Governor and Legislature has to face what we faced last year -- a mammoth, historic budget deficit.
Let's face it. Government is hard-wired to spend because people in political office get rewarded for saying "yes," not for saying "no." Disciplined decision-making usually only appears in times of crisis.
Just like families and hard-working Minnesotans, we should take steps to make sure we live within our means. Even credit cards have limits. It's a time to explore ways to prevent runaway spending by state government, such as limiting the growth of state spending to something around inflation plus population growth. Many other states have taken this step, and if it's done reasonably, it works well.
In addition, my agenda focuses on four categories: Education, Jobs, Health Care and Quality of Life.

I begin where it all begins, with education.
Minnesota has a great and proud tradition of having tremendous schools. There are many wonderful teachers and educators working hard every day to keep our schools performing well.
But we also now know that if you peel back the onion and focus on certain districts or school sites, too many children are being left behind at a time when the importance of education to Minnesotans, their families and our future has never been greater. The education debate has changed. It's no longer just about how much we spend. It's also about how we hold the system accountable for better results for our children.
For decades, Minnesota was a hotbed of education innovation and we need to get back our edge.
First, we need to tackle the sacred cow of education policy -- education finance reform. It's one of the most important things we can do. The current formula is too complex and that breeds a lack of accountability.
More importantly, we need to link the actual cost of educating a child to education funding. With standards, we know what children should learn and we can figure out how much that should cost.
The current formula is an artifact of history and political tweaking. It's become disconnected from accountability measures. It's reliance on only a per-pupil funding approach too dramatically impacts our districts with declining enrollment. We can do better.
Last year, I formed a task force on education finance reform. Their recommendations will be out soon. We're eager to hear them and work with you to develop a better school funding system for our children.

We also know that parents make or break student performance. In every way we possibly can, we need to encourage, challenge and require that parents do their job. Student to teacher ratios are important. Even more important is the ratio of time parents spend on their children's education. Any discussion about education performance or accountability should start right there.
Beyond parents, teachers are the next most important contributor to a child's education. In the gallery today is one outstanding Minnesota teacher. Mark Johnson risked his own life to save the lives of his students during the Rocori High School shooting last year. Mark, thank you for your courage and Minnesota spirit.
We proposed a series of initiatives this fall to improve education in Minnesota that include:
· Paying "super teachers" a lot more for performance; · Yanking drivers licenses from kids who skip class too often; · Providing parents and others with school report cards to
improve accountability; · Making Internet access more affordable for rural schools; and · Expanding charter schools in Minnesota and more.
The Minneapolis school district is our largest and our most challenged. I am enthusiastic about the bold moves advocated by Acting School Superintendent Dave Jennings in Minneapolis. I support his aggressive and innovative approach, and we urge the Legislature to do so as well.
It's also high time to strategically re-think the future of Higher Education in Minnesota. We need to make sure the system is structured, managed and governed in an optimal way to meet future needs. We've asked the Citizens League to lead a state-wide effort addressing the alignment and capabilities of our higher education programs.

We educate our children to prepare them for citizenship, life and to be ready for the workplace. Jobs are the glue that holds our state together.
One of the most important things we can do to grow jobs in this state is to not raise taxes. Tax increases hit job creators right where it hurts: the bottom line. If we want to compete, we need to prove to job creators we mean business on taxes.
But there's also much more we can do to make Minnesota more job-friendly.
Our current tax code contains a penalty on businesses for creating jobs and investing in Minnesota. We need to eliminate this anti-jobs tax and adopt a single factor formula for business taxes.
We need to leverage our strategic advantage in the emerging bioscience economy. I am asking you to fund, through the bonding bill, the historic new research partnership between the Mayo Clinic and the University of Minnesota. I also ask your support to enhance the bioscience zones we created last year. This is a huge opportunity and we can compete and win in this area.
Building the economy of the future also means helping Minnesota's bedrock industries find their place in the new economy. Citizens and members of my cabinet are working aggressively on ways to improve the competitiveness of our timber, mining and livestock industries. All three of these industries find themselves greatly impacted by domestic and global challenges.
The strength and vitality of our agricultural economy depends on the livestock industry, which is one of the best ways to add value to the crops we grow here. We hope you'll support our proposal to provide low-interest loans for modernization that will help farmers grow and compete.

Job creators in Minnesota need access to global markets for their products. Too many businesses have to ship through Chicago, which drives up their transportation costs. I propose that we lead efforts to have the private sector develop a large-scale regional distribution center for cargo.
We're also creating a one-stop shop for job providers to untangle red tape. We're improving the permitting process. We're streamlining technology so that more government services can be provided online. And, in a few weeks, we'll be proposing a major overhaul of our tourism marketing efforts.
As the national economy recovers, these steps and others will put Minnesota in a position to retain good jobs and compete for the jobs of the future.
Next I want to talk about something for which Minnesota is world famous: our health care and the health of our people. But even we have a major problem.
Medical costs and insurance premium increases are a tourniquet that is squeezing off the blood supply to every family, business and government budget in Minnesota. We need to act before these costs permanently damage our quality of life and our ability to compete.
You shouldn't have to get on a bus to get a fair deal on prescription medicines. You should just have to get online.
Last Friday was a historic day in Minnesota. With a click of a mouse, we became the first state in the union to give our citizens access to safe, effective and less expensive prescription drugs from Canada.
Powerful forces are gathering against this initiative. I need your support to stay the course. This is not the final answer to medical costs, but it will help.

As our population ages, we also need to ensure we have the best nursing homes and long-term care for our parents, grandparents, and soon enough, ourselves. We'll be announcing a full long-term care reform package in the coming weeks. But I'm asking the Commissioner of Health to implement the first step. We want to create a report card that can be used by consumers to evaluate the quality of care at each of Minnesota's nursing homes. We owe it to our seniors to have the best possible care available ­ and that starts with accountability.
Tomorrow, we'll be announcing the principles that will guide the next generation of bold health care reform in Minnesota. The Citizens Forum on Health Care Costs, led by Senator Dave Durenberger, will issue its recommendations.
Our approach will include leveraging the purchasing power of the state and other partners to force health care providers to use best practices and deliver higher quality results.
I'm also excited about several good ideas proposed by Representative Bradley, Senator Berglin, and others.
Now, I want to talk about our quality of life.
We love it here, but not everybody appreciates our Minnesota way of life. If we're going to convince talented, innovative people to stay here, invest here, and relocate here, we've got to have plenty of live bait on the hook. That will be a big part of whether we succeed in the new economy.
We need to continue to improve our quality of life and here's what I propose.
We absolutely need to improve public safety. Nothing much matters if you don't feel safe. The disappearance of Dru Sjodin is the latest mile marker along a trail of tragedy that is traveled far too often. Those tragedies threaten to undermine our sense of safety.

In order to maintain Minnesota nice for everybody else, we need to get Minnesota tough on criminals.
In my bonding proposal, I've allocated funding for 875 new Minnesota prison beds, one of the largest prisons expansions in our history.
For our most dangerous sex offenders, we need to keep them locked up longer. I also ask you to approve my comprehensive plan to bolster the system of civil commitment for those who should never be released into the community. For those who are required to be released, I ask for your support for our proposal to make those criminals wear GPS monitoring devices for more intensive supervision of such offenders.
It's time to give the people the chance to speak on the death penalty for those who commit unspeakable crimes, such as the murder of a child. The punishment needs to fit the crime. We ask that you let the people of Minnesota be heard on this issue by putting it on the ballot.
We also need to make our travel more safe by lowering the limit for drunk driving in Minnesota to the .08 standard. That change is overdue.
In addition to public safety, Minnesotans value our natural resources.
Minnesota's farmers are the original conservationists, because the land and water are their livelihood and their heritage. With their help, I know we can do a better job of protecting Minnesota's great outdoors. That's why I've proposed that we set aside 100,000 acres of marginal farm land to act as buffer strips between runoff and some of our most environmentally sensitive waterways, to create habitat and improve water quality. Let's move forward with this initiative.

In Minnesota, hunting and fishing aren't just hobbies, they're a constitutionally-protected way of life. We're bringing a new level of accountability to the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.
We're trying to better serve the men and women who pay the bills for wildlife and habitat conservation. We've already taken action to consolidate the DNR's four fish and wildlife divisions into one, and to make sure that fish, wildlife and conservation are the agency's top priorities. We'll also continue with efforts to maintain and improve that focus.
After a decade of neglect and increased traffic congestion, in 2003 we made unprecedented progress in new and refurbished roads and bridges. Lt. Governor Carol Molnau's outstanding work at Mn/DOT financed the largest cash infusion in Minnesota history, jumpstarting many delayed projects.
We're pushing ahead with HOT lane and FAST lane projects to both expand capacity and finance the construction of new lanes. We're also working hard on local bridges and roads.
We also need to move ahead with more effective transit.
My bonding proposal contains preliminary funding for the Northstar commuter line, through one of the nation's fastest growing and most congested corridors. After rigorous review, this proposal has received support from President Bush, Senator Coleman, Congressmen Kennedy and Oberstar and many others. I also propose funding for a high-speed bus line following Cedar Avenue in the South metro.
We need to end chronic homelessness in Minnesota in the next ten years. We've developed a business plan to bring together the available public and private sector resources and expertise to tackle this problem once and for all, and we hope you'll help.

And I have one last issue that is very much on the minds of Minnesotans: gambling. I opposed the expansion of gambling in the past. However, we need to recognize that times have changed. The compacts negotiated with the American Indian tribes almost fifteen years ago do not reflect current circumstances ­ and we need to address the issue.
My preference is to keep gaming within its current contours, but we need to explore a better deal for Minnesotans, and that's what we're going to do.
This past year, Minnesota lost its head coach, Herb Brooks. During this NHL All Star week, he is being honored for all his contributions to the State of Hockey and America. He was a regular guy from the Eastside who stepped onto the world stage to face the toughest of opponents.
Herb's life is a model of the Minnesota spirit, the spirit of confidence in the face of incredible challenges. He understood that great challenges demand the best from within us.
We need to listen to Herb's locker room advice: This is our time, this is our moment.
Herb's son Dan is with us in the gallery. Dan, on behalf of us all, thanks for keeping your Dad's spirit alive.
But the Minnesota spirit is about more than tough-minded hockey coaches or military heroes, or special teachers. It's about all of us.
It's the spirit that makes us dance in the snow near castles made of ice.
It's the spirit of our rural neighbors who show up to harvest a friend's corn when they hear he's been hurt or sick.

It's the spirit that brings out volunteers for countless youth soccer teams, charity walks, food shelf collections, and mentoring programs. It's the spirit that raises an army of friends to walk the frozen, snow-covered roads and ditches of Polk County in search of a missing friend. And, it's that spirit that has brought generations of leaders to this historic room to serve. The Minnesota spirit. It's our legacy. It's our tradition. It's our future. It's made us different. It's made us great. And that's why we're here. Thank you and may God bless you. And may God continue to bless the great state of Minnesota.At 1:00 this morning, a dozen huge garage doors behind me flew open and this facility came alive as more than 15,000 blood and tissue samples began arriving from across the country and around the world. They're unloaded, processed and prepared for analysis before noon! That happens every day here because the Mayo organization of Rochester, Minnesota, does it better and faster than any place on the planet. But, 19 months ago, this building was empty and dark. The company that had built it just a few years earlier at great cost, moved its business and over 800 good jobs out of the country. It was a major blow to the Rochester area and the entire state. Today, almost 700 jobs have returned with more on the way! It's a great Minnesota comeback story. So, what can we learn from it? It tells us that Minnesota needs to be a global competitor. 
 
It reminds us that excellence matters and has a magnetic impact. It tells us again that science and technology are really important in the modern economy. It reinforces the importance of doing things fast. It again shows us the incredible value of an educated, innovative and productive workforce. It reminds us of the importance of public-private partnerships. This site was enrolled in our JOBZ program the very first day the program became available. And finally, it highlights the vast number of jobs that big economic engines like the Mayo Clinic produce - they're Minnesota's booster rockets. We all need to grasp the importance of the Rochester model. They're a successful global competitor. Why? Because they have seamlessly integrated science, technology, infrastructure, entrepreneurship, a partnering role for government, and lots and lots of hard work. Global competitiveness is Minnesota's strategic objective. We have lots of work to do to get us there. 
 
We've faced a lot of challenges the recession, the war, the ongoing threat of terrorism. But despite all that, Minnesota has tackled some tough problems and together, we've made progress. When I became Governor, Minnesota had a mammoth $4.5 billion budget deficit and zero reserves. We'll end the current budget cycle with the books balanced and our reserve and cash flow accounts restored. For sure, more budget work needs to be done, but we've made tremendous progress. We're now requiring our students to be measured against clear and workable education standards. We've taken major steps to rebuild our roads and bridges and to protect our environment. We're the first state in the nation to launch a program to help needy seniors obtain safe and lower-cost prescription medicines from Canada. And I will continue to urge the folks in Washington to open their eyes and fully open our doors to these needed medicines. We've launched the Smart Buy purchasing alliance that will show the nation how the health care market can be transformed to save costs and improve quality. 
 
Our traditional economic engines of agriculture, mining, timber and manufacturing are all displaying new signs of growth, opportunity and renewed vitality. And, through our JOBZ program and other means, we're adding jobs and growing the economy across the state. That last point is important because our progress needs to be measured by how much the private sector economy is growing, not how fast government is growing. High paying jobs are the key to our quality of life. Good jobs give our citizens the ability to take care of their families and freedom to enjoy life as they choose. The main credit for our recovery belongs to our job creators and working families, not government. This is not the first time that the importance of job growth has been emphasized in a State of the State address. You might remember that Governor Arne Carlson presented the State of the State address here in Rochester in 1994. Let me quote exactly what he said in that speech about the connection between jobs and taxes: 
"If we care about jobs, we must take a long-term pledge not to raise taxes - not now and not for years to come. Government can and must live within its means." Amen to that, Governor Carlson! 
 
A great deal has been said about my commitment not to raise taxes. It's a core value it's common sense it's important to keeping and growing jobs and it's mainstream! If you have any doubts about whether taxes are a competitive issue, look at nearby states. The Democrat Governors in the Midwestern states of Iowa, Michigan, Wisconsin and Illinois are all tackling their budget challenges while pledging not to raise taxes. They're joined by Democrat Governors in other job-seeking states such as New Mexico and Oregon. And while every state is different, Minnesota hasn't exactly been tightfisted in the last ten years. Since Governor Carlson gave his State of the State Speech here in 1994, state spending has nearly doubled. Inflation and population grew nowhere near that fast. I say again, we don't have a tax problem, we have a spending problem. Keeping a lid on taxes is not just good for the taxpayer. It's a powerful way to force government to be more accountable, set priorities and spend smarter. Let me repeat that: more accountable, set priorities and spend smarter--that's what we need to be about. But, there's much more to preparing Minnesota to become a global leader than just that, and we need to get moving. 
 
A hypercompetitive, fast-changing world demands that we approach things anew or we'll be passed by. Minnesota has more exposure to this risk than you might think. Our past success sometimes gives us a complacent attitude about change and the need to try new things. But listen to the words of visionary organizational leader Peter Drucker. He says this about the future: 
 "The things that got us here, will not get us there." The strategic mentality of too many of our public leaders today can be summed up as, "but this is the way we've always done it." We need to embrace change. We need to be bold. And, most importantly, we need to get moving. The people of Minnesota are ready for action. To the leaders in the room and to the leaders across Minnesota, I ask the question: are you ready for action? I sayLet's go Minnesota. Let's get moving. We've got work to do. It starts with setting priorities. 
 
Let me introduce you to Sara Gray. She's a senior in high school from Columbia Heights. She's 17. On the outside, she looks like a typical Minnesota teenager. She gets good grades. She was a cheerleader. She works at the Taco Bell. But she's more than that. She's a soldier in the United States military. I met her at a battalion meeting recently. I asked her why she signed up. I'll never forget her answer. She told me, "Governor, I want to serve my country. I want to give back what this country has given to me: freedom and protection." Our freedom and safety are in good hands with people like Sara and all of the men and women in our military. Join me in thanking Sara and all the people who serve. Minnesota's military members need more than our words. They need our help and support. That's why I'm asking the legislature to pass and fund additional financial incentives for service in the Minnesota National Guard as one of this session's top priorities. Next, we need to improve the way we educate our children. Minnesota has a right to be proud. But, our system of education was designed a long time ago. It needs to be updated and modernized. Last week, I announced my K12 school funding plan. It will increase average perpupil funding by 5.4 percent. 
 
My proposal offers even more incentives to school districts and unions who agree that teachers will be paid for performance, not just seniority. Minnesota is filled with many wonderful teachers, but the way we pay them is outdated. It's not geared towards accountability for results, and it doesn't treat teachers like professionals. You get what you pay for. If we pay for results, that's what we'll get. It's common sense it will help kids learn, and it will work. We also need big changes in our high schools. Too many of our 11th and 12th graders have academically "checked out." Our "Get Ready, Get Credit" initiative will give them and their parents a powerful incentive to check back in. We propose to allow every high school student to earn college credits without ever leaving their high school building. Under our proposal, a student who takes college preparatory classes and passes an exam paid for by the State, by the way will receive college credits as if the student had taken and passed the class in college. Our students will learn more, spend less time in college, and save mom and dad and themselves lots of money. They'll go further, accomplish more and do it all more quickly. 
 
Our need to improve education is not limited to K12. Higher education is not changing as rapidly as the marketplace or demographics in certain parts of the state. A prime example of that is here in Rochester. The Rochester area is projected to grow 70 percent in the next twenty five years, and its economic vitality is growing even faster. Rochester needs a strong higher education leadership structure with the responsibility and authority for decision making, and commitment to focus, coordination and planning for the future. That's why today I'm announcing a proposal for the Rochester area to take greater control over its own higher education destiny. Today, I propose that we create a university here in Rochester. The first step in this process will be to create a legal and governing entity that will be responsible for all current operations at the University Center with the exception of the technical college which will remain untouched by this proposal. The governing entity would have the option of maintaining current operations and courses or changing the focus to better serve the needs of students and the community. In the future, it might choose to become part of an existing institution of higher education. My budget announcement next week will include more than three million dollars to get this new University leadership structure started. 
 
We also need to encourage other institutions of higher learning to try new things as part of an effort to better serve their students and Minnesota. Specifically, campuses are trying to be everything to everybody. Our resources would be better utilized if we moved towards a Center of Excellence model. Winona State University President Darrell Krueger is living proof that the words "entrepreneur" and "educator" can go in the same sentence. He recently announced his retirement. As he did so, he proposed a bold new direction for Winona State. He calls his proposal "Do more, with more." He proposed increasing tuition at Winona State and using the additional resources to create a center of excellence in Winona. I'm pleased to support his exciting, innovative approach. While it may not be the right model for all our campuses, it's definitely worth a try at Winona. I'm also intrigued by the changes made in Colorado recently. They'll now send about two-thirds of their total state higher education appropriation directly to students rather than funding higher education institutions and bureaucracies. This will empower the customers students and their parents - to make choices that best suit their needs. 

I've asked Susan Heegaard, Director of HESO, to work with stakeholders to create a plan which would move Minnesota further toward funding public higher education students rather than institutions. Of course, accommodations will need to be made for high cost programs or colleges located in sparsely populated areas. I've directed her to have this plan ready for presentation during the 2006 session of the Legislature and for implementation in the 2008-09 State budget. Under this approach, colleges will need to be more accountable to their customers, more responsive to the marketplace and more accountable for results to succeed. Next, we need to make new investments that will make Minnesota more globally competitive. The list of investments to be made is long but let me focus on one as an example. Minnesota is the home of two world-leading medical research institutions located 90 miles apart. Historically, the University of Minnesota and the Mayo Clinic have been competitors. Two years ago, I was here in Rochester to announce they are now going to work together. This historic partnership will leverage the power of these two great institutions beyond what they could accomplish individually. 

The strength of their coming together will be an awesome force in the world's medical research marketplace, and it will bring great benefit to Minnesota. The partnership I announced two years ago had two key components. The first is construction of a new MayoU Genomics Lab here in Rochester. It was in my bonding bill proposal last year, and it's in my bonding bill proposal this year. I thank Speaker Sviggum and the House for passing a bonding bill last year with the project in it. I'm hoping both the House and the Senate will do the same this year. But, I want to be perfectly clear on this point: I won't sign a bonding bill this year without this project in it. The second part of my partnership plan is operating funds for research. We allocated a few million dollars last budget cycle as part for a pilot project to test the partnership and its effectiveness. It worked really well. Today, we're making the next installment payment and committing 20 million dollars more in funding for research. Fifteen million dollars will come from the State. 

And, I'm really pleased to announce that private sector partners are willing to help. The first partner to step up is Medica. Today, Medica is announcing a commitment of five million dollars. Please join me in recognizing and thanking David Tilford, CEO of Medica, who is with us today and whose foundation has committed the first legacy gift. I'm also excited to tell you that other partners will soon be joining and the total research amount will likely be well over the 20 million we're announcing today. Next, if Minnesota is going to be an effective global competitor, we need to reform and improve our health care system. We have two main challenges in this area: The first is that families and employers are being squeezed by health care premium increases they can't keep up with. They need relief. That's why we've formed the Smart Buy purchasing alliance to leverage the bulk purchasing power of sixty percent of Minnesota consumers to demand better health care at a better price. We are also proposing to empower consumers by expanding and encouraging the use of Health Savings Accounts, which are like IRAs and 401Ks, except they're for health care. They put consumers in charge and provide more health care choice and flexibility. 

The other big challenge is that our government welfare health care system is out of control and growing at a rate that will consume almost all of the state's budget within 15 years. If we don't get this under control, it will bankrupt the state and strangle our ability to fund our other priorities such as schools and roads. The longterm viability of those programs - and the state budget as a whole - demand responsible decisions now. Some will argue that we should raise taxes rather than slow the growth in these programs. That is simply unrealistic. Income tax revenues would have to double every eight years to pay for these programs at their current rate of growth. We must restrain the growth in these programs to sustainable levels by wisely and humanely changing them so they are comparable to surrounding states, and more focused on those with the fewest resources and the greatest needs. Next, Minnesota can lead the way globally by being the "renewable fuel capitol of America." We are already well on our way, and this year we will cement our lead when the Legislature passes my initiative to double the amount of ethanol in gasoline sold in Minnesota. Utilizing homegrown renewable fuels is good for our farmers, it's good for rural economic development, it's good for national security, and it's good for the environment. 

I would much rather have the fuel in our cars come from the Midwest than from the Middle East. Let's make Minnesota the Saudi Arabia of Renewable Fuels. Next, if Minnesota is going to be a successful global competitor, our government needs to be more dynamic, more responsive, and more accountable to the people. When it comes to spending the people's money, we shouldn't be afraid of the people. Today, I'm proposing what I call "Turbocharged Truth in Taxation." When each Minnesota taxpayer receives their annual "Truth in Taxation Form" in the mail, there will be something else in that envelope: three postcards one each for the county, city or township, and school district - the postcards will be called the Taxpayer Satisfaction Survey. The postcard would enable taxpayers to mail in a "no" vote if they think a levy increase goes beyond a reasonable level. If significant dissatisfaction is registered, a levy referendum on the amount of increase above a certain level will be triggered. We've got to trust the people. So once again, I also ask the Legislature to pass a carefully drawn and limited form of Initiative and Referendum. We need to allow the people the chance to directly speak on the major issues of the day. 

There are many other issues facing Minnesota. Let me address just a few more. In my address last year, I spoke on the issue of gaming. My preference then is my preference now: to keep gaming within its existing contours, but to explore a better deal for all Minnesotans. My hope was that tribes with large casino gaming interests would make a fair payment to the state in exchange for being granted a monopoly and other benefits. It appears they're not interested in such an agreement. As a result, we're left to explore other alternatives. We'll have more to say about this in the coming weeks. I will note that we are pleased with our discussions with the Tribes in Northern Minnesota that represent 85 per cent of Native Americans in our state. We also have critical work to do to improve our public safety. Methamphetamine addiction is an epidemic, a crime wave and a social tragedy rolled into one. We need new BCA agents, new penalties, new jails, new treatment options and new cleanup standards to deal with this new and deadly drug. 

We also need to better track, convict and lock up sex offenders for as long as possible. I urge the passage of legislation that accomplishes this as soon as possible. In addition to public safety, we need to make progress in protecting and improving our beautiful natural resources. Our world leading quality of life depends in part, upon the enjoyment Minnesotans get from the great outdoors and our beautiful natural resources. My bonding proposal includes significant funding to improve the environment and our natural resources, including the next round of CREP funding. It's imperative that we secure funding for that initiative this year. We also urge the Legislature to pass our proposal to create a new Conservation Heritage Foundation and pass a Constitutional Amendment to further dedicate funding for natural resources and the environment. We all know that in a fast-changing, hypercompetitive world, we can't compete if we don't change. But change we must. Minnesota loves disproving those who say "it can't be done." Can't be done? 

Right here in Rochester, we have both the world's best hospital and the world's fastest computer - in a town of 85,000 people. Go figure. We have the highest graduation rates, the broadest health care access, and the greatest level of home ownership and workforce participation in the country. And we did it all with a small population in a cold state that coastal big shots refer to as "flyover land." Minnesota prides itself on overcoming that stereotype. We know that creating jobs, educating kids and the other important work of government, takes brains, guts, speed, leadership and action. So, what is the state of our state? The state of the state is good, but not good enough. So we'd better get to work. We need to get bold. We need to get together. We need to get moving. And we need to do it now. Join me and let's go!Not far from here is a Saint Paul city park called "Swede Hollow." For decades it was a disadvantaged area of the city. There were none of the normal comforts. Phalen Creek was their sewage system.
In the 1930s, the Sanchelli family lived there. They were new to America and they worked hard. The Dad in the family was Tony. He would come home after his shift and stand on the bridge over the creek. In a wonderful voice, he would sing out over the Hollow: "America the Beautiful." You know the words ... for spacious skies ... and amber waves of grain... God shed his grace on thee.
When moms would try to put their kids to bed, children wouldn't go to sleep until they'd heard Tony sing. The lesson is, that even back then, and even for folks like Tony who didn't have much, Minnesota has always been a land of great opportunity and beauty.
We here serve a caring, creative, and hard- working people. A state of innovators. Their energy and compassion are writing a beautiful new chapter in Minnesota's history.
Thank you all for your warm welcome and your enthusiastic spirit of service.
All elected officials have a challenging job. On behalf of all Minnesota, I'm grateful for your service, and for the sacrifices your families make that allow you to serve.
I particularly want to thank the four people who know me best... but love me anyway: my wife Mary, my daughters Anna and Mara, and especially my mother-in-law, Beulah Anderson. Thank you for your love and support.
Today the state of our state is strong, hopeful, and prosperous.
· Our people are working. 
· Our students are learning. 
· And our citizens are healthy.
Despite challenges all around us, our success abounds:
· We're America's healthiest state. 
· We have just about the lowest poverty rate in America. 
· We have one of the lowest unemployment rates in the country.



· We have the highest performing students. 
· We lead the nation in the percentage of our citizens who have health insurance. 
· And we're nationally recognized for our water, great outdoors, renewable energy,
and quality of life.

All of us who have been called to serve in this awesome building have a spectacular opportunity. Everyone of us comes to this place with ideas and a passion to make things better. Let's tum that potential into results and show the country how it's done.

While it hasn't always been pretty, we've accomplished a great deal together:

· We've completed the biggest financial turnaround in Minnesota history, going from a 4.5 billion dollar deficit to a billion dollar surplus.

· We regained our status as the nation's innovators in education by becoming the

first state to adopt performance pay for teachers.

· We tossed the Profile of Learning and instituted clear, relevant educational standards.

· We started to change high school so students can make better use of their time and earn college credit.

· We laid the groundwork for a world-class higher education institution in Rochester.


· We developed report cards so parents can evaluate schools and senior citizens can evaluate nursing homes.

· We delivered a zero percent increase in premiums for state employees in our award-winning Minnesota Advantage program, because labor and management worked together to control costs.

· We launched an historic partnership between the University of Minnesota and the Mayo Clinic to advance human health, genomics, and the biosciences.

· We fought back against meth dealers and sex offenders.

· We implemented the largest transportation funding package in modem history. I thank Lt. Governor Molnau for her strong leadership on this and so many other issues.

· We provided funding for the vital Northstar commuter rail line from Big Lake to Minneapolis, and I'm delighted that we've received final design approval from the federal government just yesterday.

· We created the JOB-Z program to bring thousands of needed jobs and millions in capital investment to greater Minnesota.

· We focused on the key role livestock producers play in our agriculture economy and are helping them to innovate for the future.

· We doubled our ethanol standard, increased wind power, and implemented America's first biodiesel requirement.

· We're reforming and streamlining state government through our "Drive to Excellence" effort. And it's producing results.



· And we were the first state in the nation to implement a program so our citizens can buy safe, affordable prescription medicine from Canada.
But there's more to do.
My goal as governor is to make Minnesota the best state in which to live, work, and raise a family.
But we can't succeed unless we prosper economically.
All of us crave security.
But in this viciously competitive world, there is no security without real prosperity. And there is no future prosperity without innovation.
Look at General Motors. Look at the airline industry. Look at the stagnant economies of Western Europe. They all made promises they can't keep because they can't back them up with real prosperity.
In a changing world, our future success depends on our ability to innovate. That's great news, because innovation is what Minnesota does best.
Let me tell you about what's happening in a really innovative town I've visited several times: Benson, Minnesota, population of about 3,300.
Anytime you create something everyone needs from something nobody wants, you're getting somewhere.
On one side of town, they're building an energy plant that creates electricity from turkey droppings. With over 46 million turkeys, Minnesota has a lot of droppings.
Nearby, they make over 45 million gallons of ethanol at the Chippewa Valley Ethanol Company.
To expand their operation, they started making vodka out of wheat and rye.
Now, in order to make their business more efficient, they're beginning to use biomass energy--burning com stalks and husks--to replace their use of natural gas.
They have another company in town called Future Products, which is using com to make everything from plastic containers to tee shirts.



Benson, Minnesota, a little town on the prairie, beat winning author Thomas Friedman to the punch. He says: America can win the coming global economic battle because America is "the world's dream machine."
Let's lift up Minnesota as America's dream machine, the nation's leader in innovation.
A few years back a couple of Minnesota brothers, Ron and Dan Shimek, dreamed of a new way to heat homes--a fireplace that had no chimney, that ran on gas. They built a prototype in their garage.
And the first time they flipped the switch, it blew up the living room. But they didn't give up. They tried again. Fifteen patents later, they were the largest maker of gas fireplaces in the world!
Minnesota is successful, but our future isn't guaranteed. We have to go out and win it in a hypercompetitive, global economy.
Nostalgia is not a strategic plan. And as Bill Gates says, "Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can't lose." The challenges we face are big, different, real, and they are here.
One of our modem icons is the iPod. It entertains us with music and video. But it's a reflection of the world we live in now.
Technology today gives almost everybody access to almost everything, everywhere, at any time. It gives people previously unimaginable freedom and choice.
Government must do the same. We must innovate and offer our people a new level of freedom, choice, and opportunity. If we don't, government will become less effective. Or worse, a wet blanket on progress.
As we embark on this adventure, we should be inspired by the words of John Kennedy. He said, "Time and the world do not stand still. Change is the law of life. And those who look only to the past or the present are certain to miss the future."
Now, let's chart our course to the future.
Let's describe and declare the kind of Minnesota we want to live in a decade from now. It should be:
· A Minnesota whose education system is not only nation-leading, but worldleading, and we have the test scores to prove it.
· A Minnesota where healthcare is available and affordable to everyone with consumers in the driver's seat.

· A Minnesota that is the best place in America to start and grow innovative businesses and jobs.
· A Minnesota that is the safest place in the nation to live. · A Minnesota that has solved its racial disparities in education, housing, and
healthcare. · A Minnesota that has conquered chronic homelessness; doubled its use of
renewable energy; and has a modem, efficient, and energy-saving transportation system. · A Minnesota where water pollution only appears in the history books. · And... a Minnesota where the traditional family structure is revitalized and life is protected and respected.
All of these goals will require innovation. We can make progress towards some of these goals this year. Others will take longer.
We're great innovators because we're free to dream. The ultimate protectors of our freedom are the men and women who serve in the United States military.
However, we all know that freedom isn't free. But we also know that not everybody pays the same price. All pay something, some pay a little more, some pay a lot, and some...pay with the ultimate measure of their service.
In six days, I'll be traveling to Camp Shelby, Mississippi, to say thanks and farewell for now to 2,600 Minnesotans who will be shipping out to Iraq. Some of those soldiers are watching us today via the internet. Let's look at the camera at the back of the chamber and give them our best wishes for a safe and successful mission.
I'd also like to recognize three people to whom we owe a debt of gratitude and who symbolize the selfless service of our military:
Merilee and Daniel Carlson lost their son Michael in Iraq last year. One of our own here in the Capitol endures the same grief, and carries the same burden of sacrifice. Senator Becky Lourey lost her son Matthew in Iraq last May.
Please join me in showing our appreciation for the tremendous sacrifice of the Loureys, Carlsons, others who have been lost, all the men and women who proudly wear the uniform, and their families.
We need to give them more than our applause. I've put forward a package of proposals to further support members of. our military and veterans. It includes an income tax exemption for military retirement pay and other assistance programs.
Please pass this legislation as soon as possible.



Now, to the other work that lies before us in this short, non-budget session.
There are four things that will make the biggest difference in creating Minnesota's future: education, healthcare, natural resources, and growing jobs.
Education made Minnesota what it is today, and education will make us what we will become tomorrow.
I read about a new Saint Paul school teacher the other day. She walked into her classroom and found that there were great needs. She realized her students spoke five different languages. Her name--Harriet Bishop, Minnesota's first school teacher. The year: 1847. She overcame great difficulties and succeeded. We honor her as the founder of Minnesota education. She rose to the challenges of her time. Let's rise to the challenges of our time.
I ask that you pass the early childhood education initiatives I announced this week to help make sure our youngest get a better start in the education race.
We also need to make sure that more of our resources get where they matter most. Let's require that at least 70 percent of school funding actually reaches the classroom.
We also need to realize that science and math are the currency of our new economy. We need more rigor in these areas.
We should upgrade our school standards to require Algebra One by eighth grade and Algebra Two and Chemistry to graduate from high school.
And while we're at it, let's bring a lesson from the game room into the classroom, by including digital literacy as part of our school standards so that our kids know how to access and use technology as a basic skill.
Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate programs provide the rigor and relevance we need to prepare our students for the future. But they're not available to most of them.
I'm proposing that we provide seven million dollars in financial incentives for at least ten pioneering districts to use AP or IB for all students, in all grades.
In addition, we need to transform our high schools so we are better preparing our young people for the economy of the future. Academic progress in our secondary schools has flattened out.



Let's provide funding so up to five pioneering high schools can show the way by fundamentally overhauling their structure to focus on college preparedness or technical training that is relevant and rigorous for all students.
And if we want to further capitalize on the vastly growing Chinese market, more of us will need to speak their language. I'm directing the Department of Education to develop model Chinese language curriculum so it's available to every school district.
Success for Minnesota in a global economy also demands that we develop the potential of all our citizens. Disparities in graduation rates and academic performance between white students and students of color continue to be a moral, social, and economic crisis.
But, there are rays of hope.
Andersen Open, a K-8 school in the Phillips Neighborhood of Minneapolis, is an example of a school that is beating the odds through innovation, hard work, and high expectations for everybody.
Ninety-three percent of the students at Anderson Open are disadvantaged and 53 percent come from homes where English is not the first language. Last year, the school joined the Teacher Advancement Program and it's now part of Q Compo.
Teachers are paid for performance, meaningful professional development is provided for staff, and rigorous evaluation of instruction is conducted.
The results are remarkable. In just over one year, the students have improved on every measurement. The number of students passing the Basic Skills Test went from 38 percent to 62 percent!
This is possible because of the strong teaching staff and the strong leadership of the school's principal, Mark Bonine. Mark's message is clear: He sets high expectations for all students and all teachers.
Let's thank Mark, who is with us today, his staff, and all of Minnesota's great educators for their hard work and dedication.
While progress is being made, we can do more.
I've proposed school choice as an alternative for poor, failing or disabled children. The legislature should pass school choice as an alternative for at least our most disadvantaged students.
In the meantime, we should pursue other new and innovative approaches that produce results, such as the The Knowledge is Power Program, or KIPP schools.



These are rigorous, public, college prep schools where disadvantaged students develop the knowledge, skills, and character needed to succeed in top quality high schools, colleges, and the competitive world beyond.
I'm directing our Department of Education to seek out and authorize KIPP charter schools in Minnesota, focusing on areas where our needs are the greatest.
In addition to improving our education system, our future success also depends on innovating and improving our healthcare system.
People currently excluded from health insurance tend to be the working poor.
Basic health insurance is available for less than 200 dollars per month. We need to direct our HMOs and insurance companies to raise awareness and get more uninsured people to use these plans. We may also need to consider incentives or requirements for uninsured citizens to have health insurance coverage.
Let's also measure and pay for better healthcare outcomes. What gets measured and paid for, gets done.
We can start by focusing on chronic conditions like childhood obesity and diabetes, which are significant problems in our society.
There are clear best practice measurements for treating these diseases that will save lives and save money. We should begin to reward providers for meeting these performance measurements right away.
Today I'm directing the Department of Employee Relations to incorporate "pay for performance" into the state's health plan and will ask the Legislature to expand this approach to all public programs.
We must also control other healthcare costs. Every business can tell you how much they charge for their service. Healthcare providers should be able to do the same.
Last year, we required some healthcare providers to supply some cost information. Now it's time to require it from all providers and for more procedures.
We must also focus on reducing administrative costs in healthcare.
Say your grandma goes to a new doctor. They hand her that annoying, long form, with all the questions she's had to answer ten other times in ten other offices. The doctor asks her what medicines she takes, and all of us have trouble remembering the names and the dosages. Maybe the physicians can't treat her until her medical file has been transferred

from across town. And then the providers, patients, and the insurers engage in a paper war over what to pay for.
In the meantime, grandma's mailbox fills up with paper that says, "THIS IS NOT A BILL."
We need to help healthcare administration enter the 21 st century. We need electronic medical records.
I am proposing a 12 million dollar program to help small healthcare providers make the transition to an interconnected electronic medical record system so that medical errors are reduced and healthcare is improved. Today I am also challenging the providers and healthcare plans to match this amount so we can make progress more quickly.
Finally on the issue of health, Minnesota is recognized for our public health and emergency response systems. But as we face the threat of a worldwide bird flu pandemic, we need to be even better prepared. I propose we bolster our efforts with an immediate ten million dollar infusion of funds to further strengthen our defenses against this threat.
While we work on the health of our people, we must also work on the health of our natural resources. They help define our quality of life in this beautiful state.
The threat to our natural resources is growing faster than our ability to protect them.
But to do so properly, we need a plan. I am grateful for the recent efforts to reform the governance of the great outdoors and the use of the Environmental Trust Fund. Please pass these reforms this year. But let's also take the next step, and fund the development of a long-term, statewide strategic plan for conservation.
I also urge you to pass a Constitutional Amendment to dedicate funding for conservation and clean water. Don't water it down, don't make it too broad. Just pass it.
In the land ofl0,000 lakes, water matters a lot to all of us. Too many of our lakes are in trouble and they need our help.
So while we're waiting for the Constitutional Amendment to pass, let's make a 20 million dollar investment, right now, for Clean Water Legacy funding.
I also urge you to approve my bonding request for 200 million dollars for conservation, the outdoors, and parks.
Likewise, let's pass my proposal to achieve a 90 percent reduction of mercury emissions to keep the air and water clean for our kids.



We can also help our environment, and gain economic advantage, by leading further . . innovation in renewable energy. The world demand for fossil fuels is exploding but the supply is flat. That's a big problem, which needs to be addressed.
Let's face it. Washington has been slow to lead on this issue. But we can't afford to wait for them. Let's lead the way and set a strategic goal of "25-by-25"--so that 25 percent of all types of our energy will corne from renewable sources by 2025.
To accomplish this goal, we need to make big progress with our cars.
In Brazil, cars run on fuel with 20 to 100 percent ethanol. Yet, U.S. automakers say they can't provide us with these cars because there are not enough ethanol pumps to service them.
Let's fix that.
Currently, most gas stations offer three octane levels. It's time we change one of those to E85.
In 2004, I signed an executive order that requires the state to purchase renewable fuel vehicles. Today, I've signed an executive order to require state employees to actually use E85 in our state vehicles.
Many of the proposals I've outlined in education, healthcare, and natural resources will take money.
But adding unnecessary economic burdens won't help.
In the Boeing assembly plant, while they're building the planes, they hang big, yellow weights on the wings until the engines arrive. On the weights is written: 8,000 POUNDS. REMOVE BEFORE FLIGHT. If we expect our economy to fly, we need to remove some of the weight we hang on it.
In a hyper-competitive economy, raising taxes is a bad strategy, especially in an already highly-taxed state.
Fortunately, we don't need to raise taxes. Our strong economy has generated double digit revenue increases this biennium. The best way to generate revenue is to keep our job providers growing.
In strategic ways, we must reduce the burdens that government places on job providers and taxpayers in order to spur economic growth.

So, in this short session, let's focus on a fe';V key priorities in this area.
Let's put a cap on property taxes.
Let's accelerate the move toward a single sales factor corporate tax so we don't punish job creation and plant expansion in Minnesota.
Let's encourage our dairy producers to innovate by passing a dairy investment tax credit.
And here's a no-brainer: Let's eliminate the marriage penalty in our tax code.
One of the most important roles of government is to protect its citizens. Sometimes that means protecting them from their own government. I urge us to corne together to pass meaningful and responsible reforms to Minnesota's eminent domain laws.
Finally, let's not be afraid to debate and take action on issues which make some in this building nervous, but that are supported by most Minnesotans.
Let's walk the walk and hold ourselves more accountable by passing performance pay for politicians.
Let's encourage and welcome legal immigration, but make sure we're not looking the other way on immigration that's illegal.
And let's make sure that courts can't throw out our defense of marriage laws in Minnesota, like they have in other states. Let's define marriage in our Constitution as being between a man and a woman.
We shouldn't be afraid of rational and robust debates about these issues. This building was built for just such debates and the foundation and the walls are strong.
One of Minnesota's most recognizable symbols is the Split Rock Light House on the North Shore of Lake Superior. It was built a hundred years ago to help ships find their way to safety on the world's biggest, and most unpredictable lake.
Minnesota is and always has been a "lighthouse" state. We are a beacon of hope, optimism, and the innovative spirit to get things done.
Harriet Bishop was a lighthouse, bringing education to the frontier.
Dred Scott, a one-time Minnesota resident, was a lighthouse of freedom for those forced to be slaves.
Sister Kenney was a lighthouse of healing for the victims of polio.


Norman Borlaug was a lighthouse, finding new ways to feed the world.
Minnesota's corn growers, who began the ethanol revolution, were a lighthouse--showing the way to a better energy future.
The Mayo Clinic is a lighthouse of medicine, shining its beacon across the whole world.
And in his own way, as a ball player, Kirby Puckett was a lighthouse, showing that passion could defy gravity... with a smile.
A lighthouse works "because it rises above the circumstances to do its job and shines its light a long, long way off.
I want this historic building to be a lighthouse again. For that to happen... we all need to rise above the circumstances of politics and personality and look to the future.
John Kennedy put it best when he said, "In the final analysis, our most basic, common link is that we all inhabit this small planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children's future. And we are all mortal"
He's describing us.
Years from now, the configuration of politics and personalities currently in this place will matter little.
What will matter is how we lived, how we served, and how we made things better.
May God open our eyes to our common purpose, guide our service in this time and place, and continue to richly bless all the people of Minnesota.
Thank you all.Thank you. Well this is now my fifth State of the State address. I never really thought I had that much to say. In all the years I spent in this chamber, I sometimes saw Mr. Lincoln looking down on us and wondered what he might have thought.
I think he might say that politics and politicians aren't too popular these days and our first job is to work together to reestablish the people's trust in our government.
In response to political criticism, Lincoln once said this, "If I were two-faced, why would I be wearing this one?"
The face of state government needs to be trustworthy and open.
We serve in this beautiful and historic building, by the people's choice, to do their work with a spirit of humility, service, and gratitude.
Minnesota is incredibly blessed in every way. They say that gratitude makes way for more blessing.

So, let's begin by expressing our gratitude for those who carry the heaviest load for our nation and state.
During the past four years, the First Lady, who is with us today, and I have had a chance to spend a great deal of time with members of our military and their families. We have seen their uncommon courage and extraordinary dedication. These brave men and women come from all over our great state,' and they are inspiring examples of duty and honor.
The First Lady and I went to Kosovo a few years ago to visit the many troops from Minnesota National Guard who are serving there to keep the peace. While we were there, we met Sergeant Mark Gaulke. Mark served in the military for 28 years before retiring in 2005.

Mark is with us in the gallery and he's holding a picture of his daughter, Jessica. She is a student at Augsburg and is currently on her honeymoon, otherwise I'm sure she'd want to be with us today. Jessica just stepped down as Minneapolis Aquatennial Queen of the Lakes, but not because of her wedding. She stepped down because she will be deploying soon with her National Guard unit for a tour of duty in Iraq.
Members of the United States military deserve our deepest appreciation. Join me in thanking Sergeant Mark Gaulke, Specialist Jessica Gaulke and all the men and women of our military, their families, and our veterans.
The news last week that 2,600 members of the Minnesota National Guard will have their tours in Iraq extended hit our

military families and their communities really hard. It frustrates and disappoints all of us. But I know the quality of these people: They will continue to do their duty with excellence.
The burden under which they are serving today strains ·even their steely and selfless commitment.
We need to do our duty by supporting them and all members of the military with our words and our deeds. We need a surge of support for our military families, and we need it now.
I'm calling on every Minnesotan to find a way to express support for these outstanding Americans. Here are just a few ways that you can help: Buy a "Support Our Troops" license plate. Help an organization geared towards assisting the military or veterans. Go on the Governor's web page and sign up for the First Lady's Military Family Care Initiative. Donate money to the Minnesota Military Family Foundation or the Minnesotans' Military Appreciation Fund. Attend an event like a deployment or welcome home ceremony to show your support. Pick up the tab at a restaurant for one of these heroes or their families. If you see them around town, stick out your hand, shake their hand, look them in .the eye, and give them heartfelt thanks from a fellow Minnesotan.
I proposed a veterans and military package along with· Senator Vickerman, Representative Haws, Representative Severson, and others. It includes a tax exemption for military pension benefits, a Minnesota GI bill for college expenses, which I look forward to working with the Attorney

General on, she has a similar proposal, it also has full funding for the National Guard's budget requests, and. dramatic increases for Minnesota's veterans programs.
Please pass it; we owe it to these great heroes.

One of the privileges of serving here is being able to work in this amazing bUilding.
Cass Gilbert and all those who designed the Capitol left us a message.
They put a sculpture on top of the Capitol called "The Progress of the State," or the Quadriga.
In the sculpture, a person rides a chariot carrying a banner that says "Minnesota." Now, the golden guy in the chariot is not Joe Mauer, he's called "Prosperity." I think here is the lesson:
The progress of our state depends on prosperity, but it also depends on all of us working together.
In the statue, two strong women are out front leading and guiding the four golden horses. Like these leaders, Democrats and Republicans need to work together to guide our state in a common direction. We have plenty of powers here, that's not the problem: The key is pulling at the same speed, in the same direction - all in the name of progress and prosperity for the citizens we serve.

The state of our state is great, but we can make Minnesota even better.

There are many important things we need to do to advance

prosperity and prepare Minnesota for the future this session,

such things as improving our transportation system,

enhancing public safety, continuing to support agriculture

and our natural resource-based industries, maintaining a

pro-job business climate and stimulating rural economic

development.

'

But in the short time we have today,' I want to focus our common efforts to steer four big "horses" that will have a very large role in powering Minnesota's prosperity and progress.

They are these:

· Better Government · Better Energy · Better Education, and · Better Health Care


Government provides important services and has an important role to play. But we need to be careful, so that our desire to do well through government doesn't slowly suffocate and stifle one of our key advantages: the unprecedented freedoms and liberties we possess and the personal responsibility that comes with it.


This building is filled with ideas, philosophies and agendas that call for government to do more, and more and more. That inevitably leads to demands for more taxes, more regulation, and more bureaucracy.
A key measure of good government is this: Do the taxpayers get good value for the money they pay? During the past four years, we've made some great progress on this front. Let me give you just one example.
Brenda Willard is a manager in our Administration Department. She and her colleagues helped develop purchasing standards and policies for state computers, cell phones, and furniture that will save the state over $22 million. That's the combined annual tax bill for 1,100 Minnesota families! Brenda is with us in the gallery today. Let's thank her and all of her colleagues and team members for their great work.
When my budget is released next week, you will see a key theme: 'Minnesota government should stop paying for good intentions and start paying for better performance.
I'll be more likely to reach for the signing pen, rather than the veto stamp, if the bill on my desk clearly defines expected results. It should also have clear measurements for those results and link spending to performance, rather than just wishful thinking.
We owe that to the hard-working taxpayers of this state.

And just like Minnesota families, state government needs to live within its means. We just climbed out of an epic budget hole, and we're not going to spend our way back into one!
Under the November budget forecast, state spending will go up about $1 billion automatically because we'll be serving more people under our entitlement programs. Beyond that, an additional $2 billion is available for use. That means the state can use about $3 billion in the upcoming budget cycle.
That would be about a 10 percent increase over the current
budget. Ten percent growth is more than most Minnesotans will see in their paychecks and it should be enough growth for their government, too.
I've said it before and I'll say it again - Minnesotans are not undertaxed.
We should lessen their burden by cutting taxes. Thanks for your efforts to pass the bill which provides tax relief for college tuition and other education costs. I urge you to pass additi08al tax-cutting legislation this session that provides property tax relief, tax relief for veterans, and other tax cuts that will strategically help our economy.
I also continue to urge you to cap property taxes by placing a limit on how much any local unit of government can . increase property taxes without voter approval. Now some have opposed this idea by citing the need for "local control." That's understandable, I've heard those concerns and today I offer a compromise by proposing to exempt any local unit
..
of government from this requirement if they get less than a third of their general fund revenues from the state.

But being fiscally responsible is not our only duty. We need to aggressively prepare for the future in other ways.

Renewable energy is an important part of Minnesota's future.
Our great nation's sad addiction to foreign oil exposes the country to a reckless amount of economic and national security risk.
Even worse, as with many addicts, we are buying from some of the very people who, in many cases, want to hurt us.
Our nation has been asleep at the switch on energy policy for decades. The good news is that while much of the country has just begun to hear the energy wake-up call, Minnesota has been an early riser. While others slept in on renewable energy, we got up early, we made the coffee, we cooked the breakfast, we read the paper, we did some chores and we took the dog for a walk.
An example of our renewable energy leadership is Mark Willers, who is with us today in the gallery. Mark and his family have a farm near Luverne. He is also on the board of a farmer-owned ethanol co-op and he heads up a local wind energy company.
Mark represents the visionary farmers who didn't wait for the future to happen to them. Let's thank Mark and all of our Minnesota energy pioneers for their great work that got us to this point.

Minnesota has great renewable energy policies. Now let's show the nation how to move even more boldly towardS energy independence.
I strongly urge you to consider my "Next Generation Energy Plan," add your own good ideas, and let's pass a comprehensive renewable energy plan as soon as possible.
That plan will help us move away from fossil fuels, and it will also help us clean up the environment and improve the environment. But we can do even more. Minnesota can't reverse global climate change by ourselves, but we can do our part and help lead the way. Our energy plan will significantly reduce the amount of carbon we put into the atmosphere.
I look forward to working with the Democrats and the Republicans to pass and sign comprehensive historic renewable energy legislation this session.
While we're talking about improving our environment, there's another step that needs to take place and I hope we'll take it this session - and that's finally passing a constitutional amendment to dedicate funding for the outdoors and conservation. We've come close in past years, but our environment can't wait anymore. I continue to support this important effort and urge you to do so as well.


Another fundamental key to making Minnesota better socially and economically is the urgent need to make our schools even better.
Now, you all know that Minnesota is at or near the top in most measures of student performance. Nearly every state would love to have our school performance results.
We're blessed with fantastic educators, engaged parents and, of course, we have above average students.
But nation-leading in student performance isn't good enough anymore. Our students need to be world-leading, not just nation-leading.

In any discussion, though, regarding education, the debate about the level of funding consumes most of the oxygen in the room. Very little time gets actually spent on the reforms needed to modernize our education system. So, let me address funding right up-front.
My budget next week will propose an increase of up to four percent per year for our schools for general purposes, plus increases in many special aspects of education funding as well.
But we're not just going to pay for good intentions anymore. We're going to pay for better performance as part of a new "Successful Schools" initiative.

Every district will get a general formula increase. of two percent in each of the next two years. Each school will also be eligible to receive an additional two percent per year as a performance bonus if the school achieves or maintains at least a three-star rating in reading and math on their Minnesota school Report Card. That's not a particularly high bar.
My budget will include $150' million for the bonus portion of this "Successful Schools" initiative. We need to pay for performance and quit enabling schools that don't meet our expectations.

Another hard reality we must face is this: American high schools are obsolete in their current form.
One of the most forward thinkers of our time, Bill Gates, said this: "", our high schools - even when they're working exactly as designed - cannot teach our kids what they need to know today. Training the workforce of tomorrow 'with the high schools of today is like trying to teach kids about computers on a 50-year-old mainframe. It's the wrong tool for the times." Close quote.
U.S. students score near the top on international test scores in 4th grade, but by 8th grade our students are about in the middle of the pack and by the end of high'school they are near the bottom.

Too many of our high school students today are engaged in academic loitering for much of their high school career. In too many cases, our high school students are bored, checked-out, coasting, not even vaguely aware of their posthigh school plans, if they have any, and they are just marking time.
It's costing us a lot of money and it's costing them their future. This is a silent crisis and has the potential to devastate our future prosperity if we don't fix it.
We made some good strides last year, and in proceeding years, but much more needs to be done. Let's make Minnesota the number one state in the nation for reforming high schools by creating "3R" high schools. The three Rs here stand for rigor, relevance, and results.
My budget next week will include $75 million in funding to encourage high schools to become "3R" schools. This is also a pay for performance deal. They will be required to do a lot. First:
(1) 3R schools will be required to implement rigorous and relevant courses for all students, including career and technical courses in high-demand fields.
(2) 3R schools must provide access for all students to programs that provide college credit opportunities.
(3) In 3R schools, every student, every student, must complete a full year of college while in high school.
(4) And in 3R schools they must provide opportunities for students to pursue work-based learning and internships.

We hope that every high school will become a 3R high school. But even if they choose not to, the program will be optional, all high schools will still be required to make other changes.
So, our budget will provide additional funding for more schools to provide AP or IB programming for all students in all grade levels.
My budget will also provide funding to transform more schools so they focus on science, technology, engineering, and math. We will also be asking the Legislature to take three additional steps this year: (1) adopt new, more rigorous math standards for all our students; (2) require an individual graduation plan for 8th graders and above that
parents will need to sign each year; and (3) require that all
students complete four years of a second language in order to graduate from high school.
Now, this may all seem like a big leap, but the bar is very high. I urge you to pass significant high school reform this session.

But we also need to change and modernize the way we deliver instruction.
I was told the other day that a majority of teenagers now spend up to 50 percent of their waking hours interacting with a device: televisions, iPods, YouTube, e-mail, text messaging, the Internet, cell phones, video ga"mes, digital cameras, and the list goes on and on and grows by the day.

I was with my daughters just the other day at a mall in Eagan and they noticed a cell phone store next to the place we were going into. They begged and pleaded with me to go into the store just to look at some of the new phones, even thought they knew we weren't' going to be buying one.
Now as you all know, the cell phones of today are not just phones. They're much more, both technologically and socially. I said okay, and they ran ahead of me and into the store with great excitement and glee. When I entered a moment later, they were standing in frozen awe with their mouths open in front of the display containing a "Sidekick III with illuminating features."
It took me a moment to bring them out of what appeared to be some sort of technology-induced trance or coma. Then, I burst their bubble. I told them that Apple had just come out with a new phone and that its makers believe it will leapfrog all other phones and hand-held technology on the market. I jokingly told my kids they had already fallen behind. They were stunned but we spent the next ten minutes talking about the all about the capabilities of the new Apple iPhone. And this is not uncommon for kids if this generation...
Learning and interaction for today's children is profoundly, profoundly different than even a short time ago. In many ways, they communicate, they socialize, and act differently because of technology.
Our education system is behind the times and out of sync with this new reality. Our primary method of instruction is to have adults with dry erase markers lecturing to often

bored students who carry home backpacks so full of paper they look like they could be training to join Will Steger on an Arctic expedition.
We need to move Minnesota into the modern age by making things like more on-line learning opportunities available to
our students. If done well, these courses can open world-
class instruction in almost any subject to every student in all corners of our state.
To get us there, though, my budget will provide funding to enhance current on-line opportunities, as well as remove the financial barriers for districts wanting to purchase online course work.

All of these initiatives will help students be academically better prepared to go beyond high school. But we also need to do more to get them and their families more financially prepared to go to college.
Last summer, I announced my ACHIEVE proposal to provide two free years of college in Minnesota for top performing students. I continue to think that proposal is a good idea, and urge you to pass it. ACHIEVE provides a powerful incentive for students to study hard throughout their high school career and it increases the likelihood that our most talented students will stay in Minnesota at a time when competition for top talent is more fierce than ever.

I have heard the concerns about this proposal from those who feel ACHIEVE is too focused and too heavily weighted on just top performing students.
So, in the spirit of compromise, I offer you an alternative proposal, I'll call it ACHIEVE II which addresses both preparing for and paying for college. Under this proposal, high school students who take rigorous college level courses while in high school can earn college credit and receive a scholarship that they will be able to use at any college or university in Minnesota. If a student finishes a year of college in high school, they will receive enough money under the scholarship to pay for an average year's tuition and fees at a Minnesota public university regardless of their class rank and regardless of their ACT scores. So it will be open and serve many more students than the original ACHIEVE proposal. This will result in students who take a year of college in high school, they will get at least a free year of college, and the program will benefit many, many students.

We also need to make sure, though, that education funding as possible reaches the classroom where it matters most. So I again encourage you to pass my proposal requiring that at least 70 percent of the money get into the classroom. We can improve our children's future by improving our education system by driving resources and money into the classroom.

We also need to improve our higher education system. My budget will contain substantial increases for our colleges,

universities and tuition aid programs. For the first time, it will also contain $50 million in performance bonuses for higher education institutions that achieve clearly defined and obtained strategic goals.

It's also clear that we need to do more to help our youngest learners. They need to be better prepared for kindergarten and the school years beyond. The payoff can be well worth the investment. There have been a number of early childhood ideas already discussed during the opening weeks of this legislative session.
One of those ideas is all-day kindergarten. I believe all-day K has merit, but it is enormously expensive if it is required for all kids statewide. Its price tag is $320 million and it would not be targeted to the kids who need it the most. The truth is that children from advantaged backgrounds don't generally have an elementary academic performance problem. In an era of limited resources and seemingly limitless needs, we need to focus and prioritize our efforts and our money.
With all of that in, mind, I'm proposing an early childhood scholarship program to provide up to $4,000 per child for at-risk students to attend a certified kindergarten readiness program of their choice. This will get help to the kids who need it most and, hopefully, it will help close the achievement gap, which we need to work on more. We've made progress, but not nearly enough and not nearly fast enough.

As you can see, we have much work to do in education.
Let's not allow our nostalgia to limit our children's future.
We owe our children their own future, not our past.

We have other large challenges and opportunities in front of us. One of them is the need to fix our broken health care system. We have a historic opportunity to accomplish real reform. Let's take the journey together by passing my Minnesota Health Connections plan.
Expanding access to health insurance is a priority. But expanding access to a broken system is not a complete solution. We need to have a comprehensive approach that simultaneously focuses on improving access, improving quality, and lowering cost.
Let me start with access. We 'have a goal that all Minnesotans should be covered by health insurance. This does not mean a single-payer; it doesn't necessarily mean or shouldn't mean that the government takes over the system and pays for all of that coverage. There are many ways to achieve that goal. While we expand access, we also need to fix the underlying system and make sure that our efforts are financially sustainable.
Under current law, without anybody casting a vote, without anyone doing anything, under current law, access to our state-subsidized health care programs will expand to cover

an additional 45,000 Minnesotans this biennium. But we need to do more than that, our first installment for additional access should consist of expanding coverage to all children under age 21, not just 18, with a household income of $60,000 or less for a family of four.
But we also have to focus on cost containment. Unfortunately, providers and consumers in the current system have little motivation to contain costs. '
But market forces can help reduce cost and improve quality. Let me give you an example.
Lasik surgery was introduced about ten years ago. It was priced about $5,000 per eye and only available in limited locations. After ten years of price and quality wars in a real marketplace, the price has come down to about $500 an eye, quality has improved, and access has grown dramatically.
So while market approaches may not work for all medical procedures, we know that engaged, motivated consumers are a powerful force in controlling cost, especially when price and quality measurements are easily understood.
As the private market begins to change and implement cost containment strategies, we should study them and apply the best of them, what is working, and apply it to our public, programs. I propose MinnesotaCare II, which will take the framework of MinnesotaCare and modernize it to introduce consumer choice and competition so that MinnesotaCare consumers can obtain the benefit of lower premiums along with incentives for making healthy choices.

We will also reduce costs by creating the Minnesota Health Insurance Exchange, to allow uninsured individuals access to . health insurance that will lower premium costs by roughly 30 percent.
The Insurance Exchange will also absorb administrative costs for small businesses purchasing insurance and give the employees access to a greater array of insurance products.
Finally, comprehensive reform this year should also move Minnesota toward an interoperable electronic medical records system; overhaul our mental health system; streamline, thank you thank you Representative Greiling, Minnesota's billing and coding systems into a single operation; and advance efforts to pay for better health rather than just procedures provided.


As we finish here today, I am reminded of a story about a man of great intellect and great perspective.
David McCullough is one of the premier historians of our time. He's. taught us a lot about John Adams, Harry Truman, Teddy Roosevelt, the founding of our nation, and some of the most critical moments in our history.
I heard he recently made a presentation to a very distinguished audience. In the question and answer period, someone asked him which period in American history was most important. He thought for a moment and his simple answer was, "This one, right now."

Looking back is interesting and helpful. But we have to embrace the importance of "right now." We don't have certainty about what lies ahead for our economy, our national security, or our society. But we do know that the people of Minnesota have chosen the folks in this room to work together and to do our very best to make decisions that lead us towards a better Minnesota and a prosperity for all our citizens. Our state is filled with wonderful people. Minnesotans are kind, they're generous, hard-working, and they are born innovators. They will certainly do their part if we do ours. Together, let's focus on the future and boldly lead, right now. Thank you very much. May God bless each of you and may God bless the great state of Minnesota.More than 80 years ago, a young man from Central Minnesota made an historic journey, alone, in an airplane across the Atlantic.
When Charles Lindbergh emerged from the plane, he said just what you might expect a Minnesotan to say, "Well ... I made it." This year marks our wonderful state's lS0th birthday. For this occasion, we can set aside a bit of our usual Minnesota modesty and look back with pride on what we've accomplished together.
Our economy has successfully grown and evolved. We do everything from feeding the world to exploring the wonders of cyberspace.
We've been enriched by the presence of different cultures. We mix together, appreciating how our differences contribute to a richer Minnesota.
We've faced floods, fires, tornadoes, and wars, and we've overcome.
We've produced great people: Norman Borlaug and Sister Kenny; Seymour Cray and Earl Bakken. This special place raised Judy Garland, Prince, and Bob Dylan; John Madden, Vern Gagne, and Charles Bender; Hubert Humphrey, Herb Brooks, and Roy Wilkins, to name just a few.

Here in the Saint Cloud area, you have local favorites as well, including Alice Wheelock Whitney, Dave Durenberger, Jim Eisenreich, and Al Loehr.
On my block in South Saint Paul, it was the Bruggemans, Marshinkes, Daniches, Boljanoviches, Elsenpeters, and the Pokornys. They weren't famous, but they were pretty special, too.
I'm delighted to deliver this speech here in the "Granite City." Much of this area is built on solid rock. This area's values reflect the strength of our state and the goodness of our people.
Al Loehr is a hometown example of these qualities and values. Al was the son of a stone cutter. As a young man, Al went to work for the railroad. He went to war in the South Pacific as part of the greatest generation. He landed by ship in the port city of Hiroshima and witnessed the destruction of war.
Like many in his generation, he helped save the world and then came home and helped build his community. He returned to Saint Cloud and the railroad. He served as mayor here and led efforts to further improve this city.
He was a Minnesota Commissioner of Veterans Affairs and has given over 50 years of service to the cause of veterans. He is Minnesota bedrock, and we stand on his shoulders today. Join me in thanking a true Minnesotan, Al Loehr.

It's because of the hard work, dedication, and character of our people, that Minnesota is at or near the top in most quality of life measures.
We're number one in child well-being, home ownership and access to health insurance.
We're number one in voter turnout, Fortune 500 companies per capita, and production of medical devices.
We're number one in sugar beets, sweet corn, green peas, and turkeys.
We're number one in ACT scores, the percentage of adults with a high school diploma, and number two in the country in eighth grade math scores.
We're near the top in E-85 pumps, wind energy, renewable energy, and recycling.
We've been judged the most livable, the healthiest, the most generous, and the hardest working state in the nation.
Recently, the City of Saint Cloud won a Gold Medal as the most livable city in the world. Mayor Kleis, that's about as good as it gets. Congratulations to you and your fantastic city.
Our ambition as Minnesota leaders should be to make this state the best place in America - the best place in the world - to live, work, and raise a family.
In 2007, Minnesota faced a decade's worth of disasters in a year's time. Spring floods along our western border were followed by

massive forest fires near our northern border. Large portions of Minnesota, including Stearns County, experienced severe drought. In August, we faced the most difficult of challenges: the 1-35W bridge collapse and historic flooding across southeastern Minnesota.
But in the midst of trouble, our state and our nation saw the character and resolve of Minnesotans come shining through. Our prayers, concern, and support continue for those who suffered loss in those heartbreaking events.
Through it all, we saw the strength of Minnesotans.
As Governor, I've seen that strength many times.
I've seen it in the faces of brave military families.
I've seen it in the eyes of cold and tired flood victims absolutely committed to rebuild.
I saw it as a kid growing up In South Saint Paul, when families impacted by mass layoffs at the meat packing plants got back on their feet. I saw it in my own home when my Mom passed away and my Dad got laid off not long after.
And I've seen it in acts of uncommon heroism by regular people, like the 1-35W bridge construction worker who risked his own safety to pull people out of the river with only a broom handle.
Our state is strong even as we are challenged by circumstances.

Minnesotans are understandably concerned about a fragile economy, rising health care and energy costs, making ends meet, and government's never-ending claims on their pocketbooks.
But Minnesota is up to the challenge.
Minnesotans are smart. Minnesotans are creative. Minnesotans are strong.
We have work to do, so let's get started by putting first things first.
The burden of war has fallen hard on the members of our military and their families. In the last year, Minnesota welcomed home more than 3,000 soldiers. We also laid some of our heroes to rest. They gave us their all. Our words and our deeds need to honor their remarkable commitment, courage, and sacrifice.
We've worked together to support members of the military, their families, and veterans. I ask the Legislature to pass the military and veterans package I proposed in November.
Serving others gives life great meaning. We have with us today someone who has led a deeply meaningful life: Lieutenant Colonel John Morris, a chaplain in the Minnesota National Guard, who has spent a lifetime faithfully pastoring others.
He has also poured himself into welcoming soldiers all the way home by designing and leading Minnesota's reintegration effort. Our Beyond the Yellow Ribbon program has become the nation's foremost program for soldiers and their families, and we're so proud of its success.

We're very grateful to Chaplain Morris and deeply appreciate the great care and service he has provided to the men and women in our military. He personifies the meaning of commitment. Please join me in thanking Chaplain Morris.
Our efforts to create a brighter future for Minnesota should also focus on reducing our dependence on foreign oil and producing cleaner energy.
Minnesota should continue to lead efforts to "Americanize" energy production. We must help keep America from becoming an energy hostage to hostile and unreliable leaders like Hugo Chavez, Vladimir Putin, and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Homegrown energy will also grow green collar jobs in Minnesota and improve our environment.
This year, I'm asking the Legislature to approve up to 20 million dollars in revenue bonds to fund low interest loans for communities to encourage the installation of micro energy technologies such as home-based solar, next-generation windmills, geothermal heating, and other renewable energy sources .
We also want to maintain our status as the nation's bio-fuels champion. We were the first state in the nation to require that our gasoline contain ten percent ethanol, and we've passed a law to double that.
Four years ago, we harvested the ingenuity of Minnesota farmers and required that our diesel fuel contain two percent soybean oil.

We've improved the product and now let's increase the biodiesel requirement to 20 percent by 2015.
We should also take further steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But it's important that our efforts ensure jobs are not lost as a result and that Minnesota does not place itself at a competitive disadvantage.
Clean energy will help our environment and outdoors, and that is a good thing. Enjoying the outdoors is part of who we are as Minnesotans.
We have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make even more progress this year by acquiring one of the most breathtaking parcels of undeveloped land left in Minnesota. I propose we purchase 3,000 acres of land along the shores of Lake Vermilion and dedicate it as our first new major state park in 40 years.
I strongly urge the Legislature to seize this historic opportunity to do permanent good.
Some are concerned about funding for this purchase. The Environmental Trust Fund is the ideal funding source. It has a healthy balance and using it will not put further strain on our general fund.
On the broader issue of the general fund, we know the fragile economy is one of the largest challenges facing our citizens.
The economy has slowed down and government's tax collections are now lower than previously projected. Our state budget is in

serious deficit. That deficit will almost certainly be much worse when the new budget forecast is released in a couple of weeks.
As we tackle the deficit, we must remember that Minnesota's hardworking families are already squeezed enough. They're paying more for gas, food, and health care. The last thing they need is government rummaging around in their pockets looking for more. Government must learn to live within its means. We should not add to the burden on Minnesota families by raising their taxes.
Moreover, the well-being of the people we serve depends on their ability to have good-paying jobs. That, in turn, depends upon the willingness of companies to invest, stay, and grow in Minnesota. However, Minnesota's tax policies, job climate, and large government discourage economic growth.
We need to reduce taxes and regulations that discourage job growth, income generation, investment, entrepreneurial activity, . research, and exports. We'll need to do that in a manner that also leaves us with a stable state budget.
Our current tax system reflects the economy and demographics of the 1960s. It's outdated and needs to be fixed.
So I'm announcing that I will create the 21st Century Tax Reform Commission that will recommend tax reforms for our 21st century economy.
Unlike the State Budget Trends Study group that is already underway, this commission will specifically focus on improving

our job climate by reforming Minnesota's tax laws. Job providers, entrepreneurs, private sector employees, investors, and others who actually have direct experience in creating private sector jobs will be members of this commission.
In the meantime, I still have an important tool to restrain taxes and spending. I call it the taxpayer protection pen, otherwise known as the veto pen.
As you know, I will not hesitate to use it to stop government from digging into your wallets.
We should also protect homeowners from unreasonable property tax increases. So once again, I call for Minnesota to join the many states that have capped property taxes.
We also need to support entrepreneurs and small businesses because they are so vitally important to our economy. They create the vast majority of new jobs. That's why I'm asking the Legislature to approve my Strategic Entrepreneurial Economic Development, or "SEED" initiative.
SEED will help new business startups and grow new jobs across Greater Minnesota.
. We must also support our cornerstone industries. Two leading examples are agriculture and mining.
Today, one in five Minnesota jobs are related to agriculture, food processing, agribusiness, or related industries. Minnesota can't be a successful state unless our farmers and agricultural sector is stable and growing.

Commodity prices are pretty good overall and, after some tough . years, our livestock sector is showing some signs of resurgence.
I'm very happy to be the governor of a state with 13,000 more dairy cows than just a few years ago. The state's dairy industry is producing more milk and receiving better prices.
But we can do more.
With fewer and fewer Minnesotans having a direct family connection to the farm, it's important that policymakers take the time to appreciate and promote agriculture in Minnesota, no matter what part of the state we're from.
We can also provide more direct support to farmers in a variety of ways. One way is to continue to support bio-fuels and other forms of farm-grown energy.
Most importantly, we need to help our farmers by doing all we can to keep their input costs such as energy, fuel, regulations, and taxes, as low as possible.
Our mining sector, after a long history of highs and lows, has also rebounded well. The dramatic need for steel in Asia has raised the worldwide demand and price for taconite. That has made Minnesota's mining assets much more valuable. The reinvestment in Minnesota's taconite mines and the resulting increase in jobs and economic activity is terrific.
More companies are planning to bring more jobs to continue this "Iron Range Renaissance." More private investment is taking
place now on the Range than in decades. I look forward to making these projects a reality.
We all agree our future depends upon a modern and efficient transportation system.
We've made strides in this area, including investing more in roads over the last five years than ever before and developing the Northstar rail that we hope will eventually reach Saint Cloud.
Just a few weeks ago, I announced my bonding proposal that includes four times more funding for local roads and bridges than ever before.
I would caution legislators not to delete this important funding from the bill to insert less important projects.
Strong differences of opinion exist regarding transportation funding. But we all agree on one thing - we cannot continue the stalemate that has existed for three decades. I remain hopeful we can overcome the politics and rhetoric of this debate and pass a bipartisan transportation bill this session.
An area of great promise this session is health care.
Our job market, our families, and our government budgets are badly straining under the weighty costs of our health care system.
We need to make health care more affordable.
An excellent discussion has been going on between my administration, legislators of both parties, and health care stakeholders and reformers. I'm hopeful that a bipartisan
agreement will soon be reached to dramatically reform health care in Minnesota.
The heart of the reform is to improve health care productivity and quality by restoring the relationship between doctors and patients.
These days it seems the exam room is crowded with accountants, lawyers and administrators.
The reform will change the way we pay for health care. Currently, we pay doctors for the number of procedures they perform. Instead, we should pay for quality of care and better health care outcomes.
We can also lower costs by encouraging electronic medical records, uniform billing procedures, and by taking more aggressive steps to prevent and treat chronic conditions such as asthma, diabetes, obesity, heart disease, and cancer which account for the vast majority of health care costs.
As these cost containment strategies take hold, savings will be used to help hold down premiums. Some of the savings will also be used to extend health care insurance to more of the uninsured.
Minnesota is the best state in the nation to lead the way on major health care reform. Let's show the country how to do it right.
All of us understand that the most important ticket to the future is the quality of the education our children receive. We should be proud of our Minnesota schools and educators. They have served
us well. Our average student performance is at or near the top in most key measures.
However, we all know those averages don't tell the whole story, and that there is real room for improvement in our schools. There is much to be done, but let me outline a few proposals to help our students and the wonderful educators who dedicate their lives to teach them.
We know the most important indicator of how a child will do in school is the degree to which their parents are effectively engaged in their lives and their education. We should certainly promote, in every conceivable way, parent involvement and parent responsibility.
The second most important factor in determining how children will do in school is the effectiveness of their teachers.
We need to improve teaching and should start by expanding the talent pool for public educators in Minnesota. The teaching profession is no longer consistently attracting top talent through traditional career pathways. Predicted shortages of teachers with needed backgrounds like math and science are beginning to materialize.
Careers no longer progress in traditional or linear fashion in many instances. We need to do more to attract the best talent by encouraging and allowing mid-career professionals to enter the teaching profession with greater ease.
We should also do more to attract the most talented young people to teaching. We need to make it easier for such rising stars with needed subject matter expertise to have an alternative pathway into the profession, even though they may not have majored in education. Part of the attraction for these individuals will be a chance to spend some of their career in public service.
We will have a proposal to begin training a group of these new teachers and get them into the classroom as soon as possible. I am hopeful that the Legislature will support this important effort.
We also need to improve teacher training and evaluation. Rigorous and effective teacher training makes a big difference in student performance, and the current system of ongoing teacher. training needs to be dramatically improved.
Much needs to be done, but let's prioritize by focusing on the area of most acute need and highest impact - training for math and science teachers.
I'm grateful that last year the Legislature included funding for our regional math and science academies. However, we did not receive the amount needed or requested. These academies will give teachers specialized knowledge and enhanced skills that will improve student performance. I am asking that the funding for these academies be increased by 50 percent over the current budget level.
I am also proposing that we design and deploy a world-leading summer training institute for Minnesota's math and science teachers. The institute would feature world-class training In
teaching methods, curriculum, technology, and subject matter mastery.
We should start by training 1,000 teachers over the next two summers. The entire cost would only be a few million dollars, but it will pay big dividends.
We also need to improve teacher evaluation and accountability.
In our current system, teachers have probationary status during their first three years. During that period of time, regular reviews are usually conducted and improvement plans are instituted.
However, once teachers receive tenure status, evaluation and accountability diminish in many districts across Minnesota.
We need to implement a system of post-tenure review. We can design this system in cooperation with the teacher unions, but it must get done. It should include annual evaluations, access to additional training for improvement, and a reasonable amount of time to correct deficiencies.
We also need to come to grips with the fact that most of our kids are leaving our school system in the dust when it comes to use of technology.
The power and efficiency of technology has hardly been tapped in our public K-12 system, but it's transforming almost every other institution and aspect of our lives.
You've heard me speak many times about how our school system needs to become an educational "iPod." We need to offer
children with different backgrounds, learning styles, aptitudes, interests, and learning speeds a semi-customized supplement to their traditional learning environment through technology.
The economies of scale, variety of course offerings, quality control, and student attention-grabbing features of technology will revolutionize education within twenty years. The question for Minnesota is whether we want to lead or follow in this area.
I encourage anyone here to purchase or download one of today's state of the art video games with enhanced graphics and sound. Imagine that power being applied to fourth grade math or tenth grade social studies.
Let's get started by developing a world-class, digitally-stored, always-available, anywhere, anytime, jaw-dropping, eye-popping teaching toolbox accessible to all our teachers and students.
This would not be a state mandated curriculum. Rather, it would be a resource for students, teachers, and districts to use voluntarily to ensure they have access to the highest quality curriculum anywhere. Students could access it to get extra help, complete a course, take an exam, get credit, and speed ahead.
Right behind me, the Mississippi River flows gently by Saint Cloud. About a hundred miles or so north of here, it's a creek you can walk across. More than a thousand miles to the south, it's miles across. It's a river that's always changing, making its way around every obstacle in its path to the sea.
Like our river, Minnesota starts humbly but has an unstoppable forward momentum toward greatness. We're the headwaters state, justly proud of all the amazing things that have started here for 150 yea rs. As the elected leaders of Minnesota, the energy of our people moves us forward. We need to stay within the banks of their values. We need to look downstream and prepare for the challenges we face. And if we do that together, we'll be able to say -- on the far side of all these current troubles - "Well... we made it." May God bless you and may God continue to bless Minnesota for our next great 150 years.
One hundred years ago, John Johnson, another 48-year-old Minnesota governor, returned from the national campaign trail, stood on this very spot and called the state to unity, efficiency and investment.
He dropped dead a few months later.
To my friends in the legislature, you may not be so lucky. My health is good.
So, we'll need to work together to solve the historic challenges confronting our great State. The people we represent are watching, listening, hoping. The challenges we face are so large that we'll need the best ideas and best efforts from across the aisle and across Minnesota.
In just five days, we will inaugurate a talented and optimistic new President, Barack Obama. Our country needs him to succeed. We all wish him well and our prayers are with him.
Today, we're not Democrats. We're not Republicans. We're Minnesotans.
We're all here because we love and care about Minnesota.
Whether it's ice castles or ice fishing; lutefisk or hot dish; the Minnesota Rouser or Purple Rain; going "up north" or playing pond hockey down the street; visiting the world's largest prairie chicken or ear of corn; swapping Ole and Lena jokes or trading real-life stories of how almost every one of us has hit a deer with our car.
Or, maybe it's just the memory of sitting on a dock early in the morning, before the kids get up, with a hot cup of coffee and the lake as still as glass with the only sound being the call of the loon. That's why we love it here. We're a place that enjoys our simple pleasures.

This is Minnesota. Our Minnesota. And we wouldn't trade it for any other place in the world.
But the people we serve are up against a whole new set of difficult challenges, the worst we've seen in a long time. They need and deserve the best leadership and service we here at the Capitol can give them.
By our words and actions, let's not add to the confusion and doubt. Let's give Minnesotans confidence. Let's show them that we understand what they face and that we will make hard choices to lead Minnesota forward. Our challenge this year is not just to close the huge budget deficit. We also have to strategically position Minnesota to thrive in a very different world.
Winston Churchill once said, "If we open a quarrel between the present and the past, we shall be in danger of losing the future."
That pretty well sums up the debate facing Minnesota policy makers.
We're proud of our past and what we've accomplished together in this great State. But we can't be so in love with the past that we miss the future.
An argument between "what was" and "what is" does not prepare us for "what's coming."
We face brand new challenges in a rapidly changing world. The old ways aren't going to cut it anymore.
In Minnesota, we don't have an ocean or a big population or a warm climate, especially this week. Our main resource is us: our intelligence, our creativity, our determination and our self-reliance and most importantly, our common sense. We're going to need those traits now more than ever.
The state of our State is challenged, but overcoming challenges is what Minnesota does best. So let's get at it.
As we begin our work, let's fix an image in our mind.
Imagine a typical Minnesota kitchen table. A mom and dad have just tucked the kids into bed with a kiss and a prayer, and they come back to the table to confront economic reality.

On the table are bills, notices and a notepad with a budget that's tighter than it's ever been. Hope and fear are also at the table.
How do we pay these bills? How do we fix the car? How do we pay this mortgage? How are we going to afford college or even retire someday?
The same emotions, concerns and urgency at that Minnesota kitchen table must be at all the tables we sit at here at the Capitol - the budget hearing table, the agency tables, and the negotiating tables.
And this day, on behalf of Minnesotans sitting at their kitchen tables, I ask each member of the legislature:
Please don't add to their burden by increasing their bill from government.
Please don't take more of their hard earned money.
Please don't raise their taxes.
The couple at the kitchen table begin by setting priorities. What's most important? What can we afford? What do we give up? How can we do things differently? We need to ask and answer the very same questions.
The budget I'll be proposing in just a couple of weeks will rely on significant reductions in state spending, as well as using other resources currently available. The details of that budget will be presented and debated fully very soon. Today, I'm going to focus on the strategic steps Minnesota needs to take to prepare for the future.
We need to start by taking the kitchen table approach and setting priorities.
The highest priority of government is to keep our citizens safe and to make sure we have the capability to protect and defend.
Each day, members of the United States military put on the uniform and then go out and put it all on the line for us. As hard as we think we have it, where would we be without them?

Staff Sergeant Chad Malmberg is a member of the Minnesota National Guard Red Bulls.
While deployed in Iraq in January of 2007, Sergeant Malmberg found himself in the fight of his life. At 27 years old, he was in command of a large convoy when they were ambushed outside of Baghdad by insurgents.
For nearly an hour they took on heavy fire from machine guns and rocket propelled grenades. Outnumbered, Sergeant Malmberg risked his life, going from one vehicle to another to help his soldiers fight back and provide cover. In the midst of this living nightmare, he kept his calm and coordinated ground and air support.
Every soldier's life was saved that day in large part thanks to Sergeant Malmberg and his tremendous courage and leadership.
For his actions, Sergeant Chad Malmberg was the first member of the Minnesota National Guard, since World War II, to be awarded the Silver Star medal.
This is a remarkable story, but there's more. When we held a ceremony to honor Sergeant Malmberg for his heroism, he didn't give a big speech or talk about himself. He came to the podium, asked members of his unit that were with him that fateful day to stand and also be recognized, and then he sat down.
That was it.
That tells you something about his character and his life perspective.
Sergeant Malmberg is with us here today, seated next to the First Lady, in the center gallery behind you. Please join me in thanking and recognizing this remarkable hero.
Sergeant Malmberg and all the members of the military are our heroes and role models, and we must support them however and whenever they need it.
Soon, over 1,000 Minnesota National Guard troops will be taking over the command of 16,000 coalition forces in Iraq. It's just one more example of the amazing work members of the United States Military do day in and day

out. Having the responsibility of a mission like that bestowed upon the Minnesota National Guard is a great tribute to them, to all Minnesota soldiers and to our state.
I'm deeply grateful for all legislators from both parties who have joined our efforts to make Minnesota the most supportive State in the nation for military members and veterans.
My budget this year will maintain our commitments to the members of the military, their families and veterans. I ask for your support in making that a priority again this session.
My budget will also protect state public safety programs and funding, and I'm hopeful the legislature will share that essential priority as well.
Our next priority must be jobs. Having a good job is the quality of life cornerstone for Minnesotans. It's what sustains them, their families, and our communities. And it pays the bills on the kitchen table.
The way to renew our prosperity is to unleash creativity, innovation, entrepreneurship and job growth.
Successful economies are built by people. Our economic landscape is shaped by men and women who see unmet needs and opportunities in the world around them, and devise goods and services to meet them. For all the turmoil in our nation's financial markets, the malfeasance, corruption, and neglected oversight, this truth remains: While government can commission public works, write checks and foster conditions for job growth, it can't match or replace the power of people who create goods, services, and jobs.
The job losses we see across Minnesota are related to a sea change in the national economy. Minnesota is not alone in this crisis, but we do face a unique challenge.
Minnesota has to come to grips with this fact: In 2009, it costs too much for employers to create and keep jobs in this state. If we want to build up employment, we need to bring those costs down. I'm proposing a Minnesota Jobs Recovery Act.

For starters, Minnesota's business tax rate is way too high. A recent study by the Tax Foundation concluded that if Minnesota were a country, we'd have the third highest business tax rates in the world. It's way out of line and it needs to get fixed.
Today, I'm proposing that we cut Minnesota's business tax rate in half. This means reducing the current 9.8 percent business tax rate to 4.8 percent over the next 6 years. This will take us from having one of the worst business tax rates in the country, to having one of the best. It will help us keep and attract more jobs.
We should also remember that small business is the backbone of our economy and has been the source of most of the job growth in the country for a long time.
For those of you who have sought a piece of the American Dream by starting a small business - by hiring your first, your fifth and your tenth employee - and who struggle to survive every day, we thank you, and we salute you.
Many of our small businesses are barely hanging on. In Washington, they're sending billions of dollars to Wall Street. Here in Minnesota, I want us committed to helping Main Street.
These days, lack of financing is a major barrier to small business success. To jump start small business job creation, I've proposed a 50 million dollar package of tax credits that will create over 100 million dollars in new investments.
In addition, I'm proposing a 25 percent refundable tax credit for small business owners that re-invest in their business quickly in order to stimulate our economy.
I'm also proposing a capital gains exemption for qualifying investments in small Minnesota businesses. This will encourage investment in Main Street and help grow jobs.
And here's another thing, companies shouldn't have to do a bunch of paperwork so they can qualify for a bureaucratic rebate from the sales tax

they pay on equipment. Let's just give them a 100 percent exemption from the sales tax - right away when they buy the equipment.
And instead of making these businesses depreciate this equipment over years, let's let them deduct the whole cost right away.
These measures will have immediate impact. They give employers a real incentive to re-invest in their companies and grow jobs.
I know these tax cuts and incentives may seem aggressive in the context of our budget challenges. But we simply have to take dramatic measures to improve our job climate and kick start job growth in Minnesota.
We should also grow jobs by enacting a green jobs initiative. New opportunities in energy from wind, solar, biomass, biogas, geothermal, biofuels and energy conservation are opening a whole new sector of our economy.
Our efforts to increase the use of renewable energy are also paying off.
This fall, the Finnish company Moventas, announced plans to build an 80thousand square-foot plant in Faribault. They'll be making gear boxes for windpower turbines and they selected Minnesota over several other states to do business and grow jobs.
This is another example of Minnesota's growing global influence in renewable energy, particularly windpower. And the tax incentives available through JOBZ played a crucial role.
I've proposed that in addition to JOBZ zones, we create Green JOBZ tax free zones for renewable energy jobs created anywhere in the state. We need more companies like Moventas.
One of our highest priorities must also be to continue to dramatically reform and improve our K-12 education system.
As I said earlier, the quality of life for most Minnesotans depends on their ability to have a good job. Those jobs now and in the future will require our citizens to have a great education and a marketable skill.

Over the last six years, we've improved Minnesota's K-12 education through a series of reforms including: raising our academic standards and graduation requirements; adopting performance pay for teachers through our Q Comp program; upgrading training for our science and math teachers; making more college credit classes available to high school students; and much more.
Minnesota can be proud that we're at or near the top in the country on many education measures. We have the nation-leading ACT scores and our students recently performed among the best in the world in science and math.
But more needs to be done. Our K-12 system is not ready for the future. The success of that system is mission critical to the future success of our state.
Times are tough and our budget crisis is huge. But even at a time like this, we need to increase funding for K-12 schools.
In exchange, we must expect more. My budget will include dramatic reforms and improvements to our K-12 system.
After parents, the quality of teachers is the most important factor in determining student success at school.
A few months ago, I proposed the Teaching Transformation Act to make Minnesota the nation's leader in teacher preparation and training.
We need to aggressively recruit the best and the brightest to become teachers. And we need minimum entrance requirements for teacher preparation programs.
We have minimum requirements for pharmacists, dentists, engineers and just about every other profession. We should have minimum entrance standards for people who do our most important job: educating our children.
The Teaching Transformation Act also strengthens our teacher certification test, requires better teacher preparation programs at our colleges and universities, and more.

We also need to continue to improve and modernize the way we pay teachers.
Minnesota has led the nation in reforming teacher compensation. Our Q Comp program gives school districts more funding if they pay staff for improvements in student learning, rather than just paying for seniority. In these districts, effective teachers get paid more.
This is a common sense program. It pays teachers better for better efforts and better results. And it's paying off.
Three months ago, the Minneapolis School District implemented Q Comp at its 16th site. When they did, Minneapolis Superintendent Dr. Bill Green said: "Q Comp schools have shown real and significant gains in student achievement. Q Comp's focus on improving teacher quality and instructional practice pays off in real gains for all students."
Because every child has a right to a quality education taught by quality teachers, I propose Q Comp be expanded to every corner of our state, every school district and every charter school.
For school districts not currently in Q Comp, this proposal will permanently increase per pupil funding by an amount comparable to a 5 percent increase in the general education funding formula.
While expanding Q Comp is a really important step, we need to do even more.
Our school finance system sends money to schools whether they're doing a good job or not. This isn't how the world works anymore, and it's not in the best interests of student learning or greater accountability.
Let's pay school districts for results. I propose we increase school district funding by up to an additional 2 percent per student for students meeting standards or at least showing reasonable growth towards achievement.
This will align the money we spend with the results we expect. It's common sense. It's how the world works, and it will continue to transform a system that is badly in need of modernization.

We also need to change the way school districts and teacher unions negotiate and settle labor contracts.
The current system is too adversarial, too uncertain and too often places unbearable pressures on school districts to bust their budgets. It also puts the interests of adults ahead of the best interests of children.
We need to bring our process in line with the nearly 40 other states that settle school labor disputes using a fair arbitration process.
This change will not undermine the ability of teacher unions to negotiate hard and receive fair wages. It works well in other states, and it will work here too.
We also need to improve the management of our schools in other ways.
Minnesota has 490 school districts and charter schools, each of which purchase IT, food services, textbooks and supplies. We should require them to come together for bulk purchasing in order to lower costs and eliminate waste.
This will put more money in the classroom, exactly where it belongs.
I'm pleased to be working with a bipartisan group of legislators, including Senator Terri Bonoff and Representative Ryan Winkler on this important step.
Of course, the need for education reform is not limited to K-12. For several years we've driven reform and innovations in higher education with incentive funding.
But our current higher education system must find even more ways to become more efficient and less focused on geography and bricks and mortar.
It's time our colleges and universities move more aggressively to deliver more of their courses online. From paying bills, and buying airline tickets, to keeping up with friends, much of our lives are now online.
A couple of months ago I met Gina Drellack, a mother of two who earned her degree from Bemidji State University -- online. She was able to take
classes at times and places that were convenient to her, including at her kitchen table. It was flexible, modern and efficient. As a result, she was able to keep her family as a top priority and maintain employment at the same time. She graduated about a year ago, and credits online learning with helping to transform her life.
I know online courses won't replace some needed face-to-face education and hands-on experience, and we don't want it to. But our higher education story needs to look and sound a lot more like Gina's story. The higher education marketplace is clearly and undeniably moving in that direction. The only question will be whether Minnesota leads or follows.
That's why I've challenged Minnesota's state college and university system to deliver 25 percent of their credits online by 2015. I'm grateful MnSCU's board and leadership have accepted the challenge and appreciate the progress they have made to this point. I also appreciate the University of Minnesota's efforts in this area.
To help our younger students get ready for this future, I've proposed that our state high school graduation standards require every student to participate in an online experience by the time they graduate.
This year, I'm also asking that we add a new element of cost accountability for higher education. It's this: we should impose a firm cap on tuition increases. Otherwise, the necessary changes in higher education we will make this session will fall too heavily on students and their families.
Next, we need to deal with the second largest part of our budget: health and human services.
As we all know, Minnesota's programs in this area have become unreasonably expensive and their cost is unsustainable.
The budget forecast shows these programs will go up nearly 19 percent if left unchecked.
We must slow down the rate of spending growth in these programs or it will eliminate our ability to fund other priorities in the future. As my budget will reflect, there is no easy way to do this. But, in the midst of these changes, we will protect all current health care eligibility for children.
My next priority is to reform the way government does business.
Workers in the private sector are facing big layoffs, big pay cuts and sharply reduced hours. Government employees will experience layoffs too. However, we should do what we can to minimize them and a wage freeze will help. I'm proposing we freeze all state government wages for the next two years.
I'm also proposing that we enact legislation to require a wage freeze for any Minnesota government entity that accepts state money.
Here's another way we're going to reform the business of government.
Our system of 87 different county governments was designed for a different era. Most county functions are duplicated 87 times over, to the detriment of taxpayers. I'm not proposing to eliminate counties. But I am proposing that we save money by encouraging counties to work together.
We should incentivize counties to create, join and operate no more than 15 new regional enterprises that will manage and run all human service programs so each county doesn't have to run their own.
We should also require local units of government to use the leverage of the state's buying power to purchase commodities such as road salt, paper and IT services at a reduced price, unless they can find a better price themselves.
It's no secret that funding for cities and counties is going to have to be reduced to close our budget deficit. Since it's not secret we're not going to send them as much money, we need to help them in other ways. We should reduce or eliminate as many state mandates as possible. We should also allow townships, cities or counties to opt-out of some state mandates by vote of their governing body.
I want to particularly thank the Association of Minnesota Counties for their vision in redefining the county-state relationship. It's a bold plan and we look forward to continuing to work with them during the session.
And county lines are not the only political boundaries that need to be crossed.
Wisconsin Governor Jim Doyle and I have been working together to find state government operations that can be combined or coordinated to save money in both states.
You often hear the reference about when "the lion will lay down with the lamb." Well how about this: in the near future ... the Gopher will lie down with the Badger.
As I close, let's go back to that Minnesota kitchen table. Yes, there's fear and worry at that table, but there's also hope, and optimism. In our own modest way, Minnesotans have a confidence that we can find a way and make it work. We always have.
A few miles from here is the College of St. Catherine, the largest women's college in America. Sister Antonia McHugh built this college from almost nothing. She was raised on the prairie at the turn of the last century. And, like many Minnesotans before and since, the things she learned in the joys and rigors of rural life gave her the skills to become a great leader.
Listen to her words describing the pioneers who came before her:
"The soul of a pioneer woman is a beautiful thing.... full of wisdom and hope and self-sacrifice.... [They] saw visions and dreamed dreams while they were facing the bare realities.... They had faith in the new land, and faith made them zealous."
As we face bare realities, we need that same faith in the future. We need to find that same wisdom and hope and willingness to sacrifice in ourselves. And like generations before us, we need help from our Creator.
As Abraham Lincoln said, without God's help, we cannot succeed, and with His help, we cannot fail.
May God bless you all and may God continue to bless the great state of Minnesota.
This state of the state address is not the most important thing that happened in Minnesota this week - not by a long shot.
The most important thing that happened this week is that our Red Bulls of the Minnesota National Guard came home.
Let me tell you what they did. This was the first time since World War II that a National Guard unit from any state was given complete command authority for such large military activities in a war zone.
They were given this awesome mission for one reason: they are the best.
If all of us as Minnesotans, in whatever our responsibilities, and whatever our challenges, can reflect even a fraction of their spirit, dedication, courage, and strength, Minnesota will continue to be one of the most remarkable places the world has ever known.
I'd also like to recognize and thank each public servant here today. Holding public office is a high honor. But honor has its sacrifices, which your families also bear.
To them and to you: thank you for serving the good people of Minnesota.
To those here today who hope to be Governor next year - I have a few tips for all of you.
First, schedule a monthly haircut to manage your mullet.
Second, try to make sure the person who is responsible for representing your positions in court, the Attorney General, is also not your re-election opponent.

Third, don't kiss an eelpout on the lips, even if the locals say it's for good luck.
Fourth, before you take the microphone at a Minnesota Wild game, carefully practice pronouncing the word "puck."
But seriously and most importantly, make sure you have a patient, kindhearted, smart, and wonderfully supportive spouse. Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in recognizing and thanking the First Lady of Minnesota, Mary Pawlenty, for her great work on behalf of our state.
Today, the state of our state is challenged, but our spirit is resilient.
Way back in 1832, explorer Henry Schoolcraft completed his quest and discovered the true source of the Mississippi River.
As we gather here today, we're also on a quest. We're looking for the true source of economic recovery.
That's what I want to talk to you about today.
The true source is not bigger government, special interests, or political parties. The true source is good jobs for our people.
We all want to maintain Minnesota's quality of life. But the term "quality of life," and all that it implies, is an empty boast if people don't have jobs.
Today, many Minnesotans live with uncertainty and fear because ofthe historically awful economy.
Many have been robbed of their dreams by the mistakes or recklessness of others. They're not statistics; they're people dealing with heartbreaking misfortune.
As some of you know, I grew up in South St. Paul. It was a town that depended on mammoth meatpacking plants and the world's largest stockyards to provide good jobs.
But the meatpacking industry changed, and the plants shut down. The massive job loss and crushing impact on families and the community was

frightening, even to those of us who were just kids.
When I was still in high school, my mom died and a few years later my dad lost his job at a trucking company. At first, I was scared and confused.
I felt bad for my dad. He was a decent and hardworking guy who asked for nothing more than the chance to do right by his family.
Many Minnesota moms and dads, and their children, are experiencing those types of feelings now.
So, the most important question before us is this: how do we best grow good, private sector jobs in Minnesota?
The people who can best answer that question aren't in this room. They're not in Congress. They're not in the White House. They're not in bureaucracies. In fact, they're usually not in government or politics at all.
The people who best know how to create jobs are the people who have actually done it.
If government listens to them, this is what it'll hear loud and clear: "Get out of our way. Leave us alone. Make it easier, not harder."
The message is clear, so let's get to work. For starters, it's plainly obvious that Minnesota's tax system is not even close to competitive. It was established in a different era for a different economy by politicians that most likely couldn't envision the hypercompetitive world of today. It's almost pre-Sid Hartman thinking.
Thankfully, we've made some progress by achieving a decades-long goal of getting Minnesota out of the top ten states in taxes.
We've dramatically slowed down state government spending.
And even in this economy, we've seen Minnesota's GDP grow more than 25% during my time in office.
While our unemployment rate is too high, it's significantly below the national average.

But, the bad news is Minnesota's business tax climate is the 8th worst in the nation. That means 42 other states have a competitive edge on Minnesota.
We have the 3rd highest corporate tax rate in the developed world. Our personal income and sales tax rates are among the highest in the country, . and Minnesota offers no preferential rate for capital gains.
We need to face the facts: Minnesota's tax system is costing us jobs, and our tax code needs to change to meet the challenges and opportunities of our time.
So, today, I urge the legislature to pass my Jobs Creation Bill that has six vital parts: 1. A 20% reduction in the corporate tax rate; 2. A 20% exclusion from taxation for small businesses; 3. An angel investment tax credit; 4. A supercharged research and development tax credit; 5. A capital gains exclusion for qualified investments; and 6. Incentives for companies to invest in Minnesota small businesses.
These steps will encourage job growth and send a strong signal that Minnesota is moving in a more pro-growth, pro-jobs direction.
These are important steps, but many more will be needed this year, and in the years to come, if Minnesota is going to be truly competitive in a changing economy.
One thing we can, and should do now, is improve and renew the JOBZ program. It's needed and it works.
Let me give you an example.
A few years ago, Minnesota Twist Drill in Chisholm was planning to leave the state. A few employees bought the company.
Using JOBZ and some other tools, they kept the company here and have more than doubled employment to 130 jobs in an area that desperately needs them.

We should also use a tool like this as part of an effort, along with local partners, to keep making cars or trucks in Saint Paul. Seven-hundred-fifty hardworking people at the Ford plant want to keep their jobs and we should do all we can to help them.
I am asking the legislature to pass my plan to create a "CARZ" zone at the Ford Plant that will offer tax incentives similar to the JOBZ program..
Here's the next thing: we need to reduce government spending because it leads to job-killing tax increases.
From 1960, the year I was born, until I became Governor in 2003, state government spending increased an average of21 % every two years. That's outrageous and unsustainable by any measure.
During my time as Governor, we've dramatically slowed down state government spending and we actually cut spending for the first time in Minnesota's history!
Most states outpacing Minnesota in job growth from 2003 to the crash of 2008 spent less, not more, per capita, on government. The few exceptions were states with sparse population or unique circumstances.
It's a no brainer. Companies make common sense decisions to grow and add jobs where it costs less.
Minnesota is accustomed to a very different model. For generations, most Minnesota politicians wanted more taxes because they wanted more government, and they got it.
They believed the presumed benefits of big government outweighed the big tax burdens placed on our citizens and job providers.
In Minnesota, this doesn't just apply to Democrats. Let's be fair about it.
This approach has endured under the leadership of previous governors and legislators from all parties, with only modest exceptions, until now.
Many have argued that was a good approach and they believe the way forward is the way backwards. My friends, it's not.

We can't afford all of the spending that's been promised and expected, even if we return to normal economic growth.
Times have changed and there's no going back.
I know this will be debated here over the next few months, and the election this fall will settle the issue in the near term.
. In the long term, however, competitive forces will decide this issue, as they always do. The future will demand that Minnesota compete or be left behind.
One thing we can do right now is fix Minnesota's budget process.
The way we budget today is backwards. Around here, we decide how much to spend before we know how much we'll take in.
That's why I am calling for a constitutional amendment to require that future spending commitments not exceed revenues currently collected.
We should spend only what we have, not what we hope to have.
That's a common sense approach understood at every kitchen table in Minnesota.
We also need to reduce spending at all levels of government, not just the state level. The property tax caps we passed a couple years ago are helping, but they expire after next year. Let's make those property tax caps permanent.
We also must balance the state's budget. Unlike the federal government, our constitution requires it. As difficult as it will be, we simply must make it happen.
As each day goes by, it becomes much harder because our options narrow dramatically. Think of this: The state spends about $43 million from the general fund each day. At this point, we're spending $2.3 million more per day than we receive in revenue.
We must act decisively and quickly.

I know the unallotments I made last summer are controversial. But, to bring needed certainty and stability to our budget during this epic crisis, I'm asking the legislature to ratify those decisions. Those unallotments simply cannot be restored at this point.
On Monday, you'll see my plan to solve the additional budget deficit identified in the November budget forecast. It will include very dramatic and painful spending reductions. While programs for the military, veterans, core public safety functions and K-12 classrooms will be protected, nearly all other areas will be proposed for reduction.
The reaction to my budget proposals from most of the people in this room will be predictable. Fair enough. I look forward to your alternative proposals.
Again, each day that goes by means more options are taken off the table, the hole is dug deeper and the problem gets much harder to solve. There may come a point where lack of action will make it nearly impossible to solve the problem if we don't act soon.
Beyond controlling government spending and reforming our tax code, we can do even more to improve Minnesota's economy and create jobs.
In business, time is money and delay impacts a company's ability to compete.
The good news is my administration has dramatically cut the wait time for environmental permits. But we can do more.
This week, I issued additional directives to state agencies that will streamline Minnesota's permitting process and speed things up even further.
Attracting new businesses and creating good jobs also depends on a well-educated and skilled workforce.
Many of our students are doing very well. But let's face the facts:.too many are not. We've enacted nation-leading reforms to improve our schools, but we must do more.

Persistently low achieving schools need new leadership, new authority, and new teachers hired and assigned based on performance, not seniority.
These changes occur most frequently when mayors are in control of a large urban school districts or when alternative school models are used.
I support giving mayors the accountability and full control, and I mean full control, of the Minneapolis and St. Paul school districts. Short of that, however, I've directed the Department of Education to use existing authority to create an Office of Turnaround Schools and make the changes I've just described.
We also know the most important school-related factor in determining how a student will perform is the quality and preparedness of their teachers.
Now, I know the teacher unions don't like it, but I again plead with you to pass the "Teaching Transformation Act." It will dramatically improve teacher quality, training, and accountability for results.
I am also asking the legislature to reform teacher tenure.
Everybody knows the current tenure system is a public policy fossil. Tenure should be renewed every five years, and it should be based on evaluations linked to student performance.
Teaching is an honorable and indispensable profession. But we don't raise its value by lowering our standards.
We also know that we can't grow jobs if health care costs are pushing companies, families, and governments towards bankruptcy. The good news is that Minnesota has led the way in health care reform, and I'm proud we have. '
Minnesota has become the most consumer-centered health care market in the country. We've taken the lead in providing consumers with information about health care costs and quality.
Minnesota is also leading the country in paying for better health outcomes rather than just the volume of procedures. We're moving from a system of "sick care" to a real "health care" system.

We also have the highest usage of health savings accounts of any state.
I ask the legislature to take yet another step toward improving the affordability and quality of our health care system.
Three plans control almost all the health care market in Minnesota. We have little real choice when selecting our health insurance.
We live in a world where we can buy almost anything from anywhere, anytime on the Internet. Why not health insurance?
I propose that state law be changed to give consumers the choice to buy health insurance across state lines.
We also need to overhaul our publicly subsidized health care system. Its costs are out of control.
Most Minnesotans who have private health insurance are rewarded for shopping smart for their health care. If it's expected for us as taxpayers, then the taxpayers should expect the same from those we help on public assistance.
I urge the legislature to pass our proposals to reform MinnesotaCare and Medical Assistance.
Beyond these important measures, we can make bipartisan progress on a number of other problems.
For example, we should improve public safety by cracking down on drunk drivers by enacting my proposal which makes it clear: "If you don't breathe, you don't leave."
We should get dangerous sexual predators off our streets by doubling their prison sentences.
We should improve our democratic process by ensuring our deployed military members can vote on time.
We should also enact a bonding bill, provided it's affordable, reasonable and

focused.
I look forward to working with the members of the legislature on these and other matters.
But, we should always remember our first priority is good jobs.
We've all experienced the so-called "Minnesota goodbye" - where the guest announces they're leaving multiple times before they actually do, It can often start at a table, move to the front door, then the front yard, and even move down the driveway with multiple hugs along the way. At its finest, it concludes with a goodbye shouted through a car window as the guest drives away.
I'll try to avoid that ritual as I leave this office in 11 months, but I do have just a few more things to say.
Minnesotans have our little quirks. But we count our blessings by what's really at our core - the character of our people and our magnificent natural splendor.
Visitors sometimes don't understand the love we have for this place. They think of it as cold, far from oceans, and a place that even airplane pilots can miss altogether.
But for those of us who live here, we understand the common sense and uncommon beauty that make our state something special.
Now, it's true, Minnesotans have to worry about such things as whether the ice will be off the lake in time for the fishing opener, kicking asteroid size ice chunks from the wheel well of our cars, and training the next generation to endure the ritual of falling madly in love with the Vikings, only to be . dumped at the altar of the Super Bowl.
We get excited at the arrival of spring, when we can once again fire up the lawnmower and the grill.
We enjoy our summer trips to the Dairy Queen with the kids. We like . bicycle rides around lakes and long, slow evenings next to a bonfire with family and friends.
But for all the reasons we love Minnesota, let's remember the real miracle of Minnesota is the goodness of our people.
Let me share an amazing example of this amazing Minnesota spirit: the St. Sauver family of Pierz, Minnesota.
Even for Joe Mauer it's a big deal to bat 5 for 5 in a ball game.
But the St. Sauver family has gone 6 for 6 in service to our state and country.
All six members of their family serve the military - and all of us - in some capacity.
Lt. Col. Scott St. Sauver leads the Minnesota National Guard's 151 Field Artillery Battalion currently deployed in Iraq. He is on his second tour in five years.
His wife, Deb, works at the Camp Ripley Family Assistance Center, where she helps Guard members and their families before, during, and after a Guard member is deployed.
Scott and Deb are incredibly proud of their four children and so are we. Chris, Anthony, Blake and Ashley all followed their father's example and each one of them joined the National Guard.
Service to a cause greater than themselves is a way of life for Minnesotans and the St. Sauver family. Everyone of St. Sauvers insists there's nothing extraordinary about what they do.
I beg to differ.
Please join me in showing our appreciation to our veterans, military members and their families by recognizing Deb St. Sauver, and Staff Sergeant Anthony St. Sauver, who are seated in the gallery.
We govern in challenging times, but Minnesota has faced challenges before. Our state has seen it all and been through it all. And Minnesotans always rise to the challenge.
Let me give you an example: During the Great Depression, one of the great job creators in Minnesota's history emerged - Curt Carlson. He was a man of boundless energy and unquenchable enthusiasm. He had an amazing ability to see opportunity even in the most dire circumstances.
Curt Carlson started his career delivering newspapers and eventually created a Minnesota company that is now known and respected around the world. Today, Carlson Companies employ 3,500 people in our state and 150,000 globally.
His personal motto would be a great approach for all of us to take into the. challenges we face. He said: "Whatever you do, do with integrity. Wherever you go, go as a leader. Whomever you serve, serve with caring. Whenever you dream, dream with your all. And never, ever, give up."
That's good advice, but above and beyond economic growth and jobs, we must always remember there's something even more important.
It's captured in the very first words of the Minnesota Constitution:
"We, the people of Minnesota, grateful to God for our civil and religious liberty, and desiring to perpetuate its blessings and secure the same to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this constitution."
These words were written by pioneers and adventurers who faced dangers and uncertainty far greater than our own.
Let's be thankful to God for our liberty.
Be grateful for His many blessings, especially in challenging times.
And continue to trust the goodness and the resilience of Minnesotans.
These truths will carry us forward to a better Minnesota.
They always have and they always will.
May God bless you and may God continue to bless the great State of Minnesota.
On January 29, 2002, as a Minnesota Senator, I attended President George W. Bush's first State of the Union address. It occurred just four months after the terrible events of September 11, 2001.
He began with these words. "As we gather tonight, our nation is at war, our economy is in recession and the civilized world faces unprecedented dangers. Yet the state of our union has never been stronger."
The President's words rang true. On the night of 9/11, I had joined with other Members of Congress on the steps of the United States Capitol, which had been spared destruction that day by the heroic actions of passengers aboard United Flight #93, led by Minnesota native Thomas Burnet, Jr.
We gathered, not as Republicans or Democrats, but as Americans. We wanted to show our nation and the world that, despite the day's horrors, our country stood strong, our leaders were united, and our government was working . . . together.
A few days later, we went together to the Pentagon and to Ground Zero.
Then I traveled with a small bi-partisan group of Senators to Afghanistan, just after American forces had routed the Taliban and al Qaeda and reopened the American Embassy, though still surrounded by razor wire and Marines.
So, when I heard the President's words, "The state of our union has never been stronger," I agreed that 9/11's disaster had united our country, our citizens, and our leaders.
I would like to say the same about the state of Minnesota today. After the most terrible economic disaster since the Great Depression; after its harsh lessons that we are all Minnesotans, whose lives, fates, and fortunes are intertwined; I wish I could say that we are all united, as we gather here this afternoon.
Whether we unite or whether we divide is hanging in the balance. The challenges we face threaten to divide us, rather than bring us together. Partisan posturing and narrow agendas threaten to overwhelm bi-partisan cooperation and compromise.
I do see promising signs of bi-partisan accord. I appreciate the constructive relationships I have established with Speaker Zellers, Majority Leader Koch, and their leadership teams; as well as with Minority Leaders Bakk and Thissen and their teams.
On the other hand, in just the second week of the legislative session, there was a hearing held on the effects of a shutdown of state government next July. A shutdown which would occur ONLY if we fail to resolve our differences before adjournment 103 days from now.

On the night of 9/11, I stood with my fellow United States Senators and Representatives on the steps of our Capitol to assure our fellow citizens that our government had not shut down, would not shut down, could not be shut down.
It is absolutely unthinkable that we would even contemplate doing so here in Minnesota. So, I ask you, legislators; I invite you; I implore you -- to join with me now, right here in our Capitol and pledge to the people of Minnesota that we will NOT shut down their government, our government -- not next July 1st, not any July 1st, not any day ever.
It should not happen; it need not happen - not as long as we are willing to work together and to compromise our individual views for the common good.
Compromise doesn't mean we have to agree, thank goodness, because we won't. It doesn't mean we can't debate, because we will. It means we can disagree, debate, and then reach a shared solution to our state's problems.
If we do so, by working together, we can rightfully tell the people of Minnesota that we succeeded. We did the very best we could, given the very difficult circumstances we inherited.
And if we all succeed together, the people of Minnesota will win. If we fail, the people of Minnesota will lose. It's that simple. It's that inescapable.
Our shared success is essential to turn our state around and get us - all of us - working again. By all of us working together.
For many years, Minnesota was known as the state that worked.
Governor Wendell Anderson, who is with us here today, is the only Minnesota Governor ever to ascend to the cover of Time Magazine for his leadership in creating "The Minnesota Miracle."
We were blessed with the largest number of Fortune 500 companies per capita of any state in the nation. Most of them were started here by Minnesotans, like my Great-Grandfather, and were built by business pioneers, like my Father, Bruce Dayton, who is here today, into successful national and international corporations.
They didn't succeed alone. Thousands of talented, well-educated, and productive Minnesotans worked hard together with them to achieve those tremendous successes.
Minnesota's economic ascendancy and social vitality were true public-private partnerships, and they occurred by the thousands throughout our state. In the fall of 1983, I traveled to Thief River Falls, as Commissioner of Economic Development, to award the first Enterprise Zone tax incentives, which Governor Rudy Perpich and the Minnesota Legislature had authorized that spring, to a seven-person business called Artco. Those business leaders and their hard-working employees built that small business into Arctic Cat, which employs well over a thousand people there.

It stands along side Digi-Key, another remarkable business success story, which its brilliant founder, Dr. Ronald Stordahl, started in his garage and which today employs some 2000 Minnesotans, who fulfill orders world-wide within 24 hours with 99.85% perfection.
Unfortunately, due to a combination of factors, Minnesota's economic success stalled during the past several years. During the last decade, Minnesota, which previously had been among the best states in the nation for economic growth and job creation, had one of the worst-performing economies.
According to a Wall Street Journal analysis, real median income in Minnesota fell by 9% from 1999 to 2008, over double the national decline of 4%. Only two other states had a worse decline. As a result, our per capita income fell from 7th highest among the states to 14th in 2009 .
Our employment growth averaged in the bottom ten among the fifty states during the past decade.
Last December, there were over 77,000 more Minnesotans unemployed than in December 2002, just before Governor Pawlenty took office. There were 5,881 fewer people working in Minnesota than there were eight years ago, even though our state's population grew during that time by over 286,000 people.
And it is worth noting that this decade of poor economic performance followed two consecutive cuts in the state income tax rates by Governor Ventura and that Minnesota Legislature in 1999 and 2000.
Fewer people paying lower taxes has meant state per-pupil aid for our students from kindergarten through 12th grade has been reduced by 14% in real, after-inflation dollars during the past 8 years. Tuition in our state's two-year public colleges has risen to the third highest in the nation; tuitions in our four-year universities are among the top ten highest.
Ten Minnesota school districts have gone to four-day school weeks, not for educational reasons, but rather for lack of money. Class sizes have grown, while thousands of talented teachers have been laid off. The average salary of those teachers who remain is 2% below the national average.
The number of road miles in poor and mediocre condition has more than doubled. Minnesota's rank among the 50 states in road condition has fallen from 8th to 27th.
Anyone who drives our state's deteriorating roads and highways, or is stuck in ever-longer metro traffic jams, or waits longer times for poorer bus service, wants a better Minnesota than this.
Any parent who has to find child care for their children because of four-day school weeks, while they're working five, wants a better Minnesota.
Any 5th grade teacher in a classroom with 36 students wants a better Minnesota.
Any college graduate, saddled with many thousands of dollars in student loans and unable to find a job, wants a better Minnesota. Anyone unable to find a job wants a better Minnesota.
Minnesotans want a better future. Minnesotans deserve a better future.

I can envision a better future.
I know what we must do to create that better future for all of us.
To progress, we have to invest. We have to invest in jobs; in education; in transportation; in the health of our people, communities, and environment; and in the transformation of government.
That is my Five-Point Plan for Future Prosperity. Invest in more jobs. Invest in better education. Invest in improved transportation. Invest in the health of our citizens, our communities, and our environment. Invest in the transformation of government services.
Investments require faith and trust. People invest in the future, only if they believe in that future. They invest, only if they trust their investing partners. They invest, only if they believe that others will do what is necessary for those investments to succeed.
To create together a successful Minnesota, we need to believe once again in each other and in our collective talents, abilities, and wisdom. We need to believe that our fellow Minnesotans are acting in good faith, doing their best, and that they, like us, want the best for their children, their communities, and our state.
So let us believe again in Minnesota. Let us believe again in one another. Let us invest together in our better future.
It begins with education.
I want to recognize and thank two of our most distinguished citizens, the retiring leaders of our two largest higher education institutions: the President of the University of Minnesota, Robert Bruininks, and the Chancellor of the Minnesota State College and university System, James McCormick.
President Bruininks has led the University of Minnesota with great distinction as its 15th President since 2002. He has served the University for 39 years, as professor, dean, executive vice president, provost, and president. Fortunately for all of us, he will continue his outstanding service to the University in a faculty position.
Chancellor McCormick began his service to Minnesota in 2001, as the leader of the MnSCU system of 32 higher education institutions statewide. He has given us a decade of strong, visionary guidance to bring those vitally important institutions together as one system. We thank him for his outstanding service to Minnesota. 
Three other very distinguished educators are with us today.
Dr. Efe Agbamu is Minnesota's Secondary Principal of the Year.
Dr. Agbamu is currently Principal at Park High School in Cottage Grove, where she instituted an International Baccalaureate program. She is recognized for her "ability to achieve academic and community goals, for improving teaching and learning and encouraging a positive school environment for staff and students." 
James Sonju, the Principal at Rochester's Lincoln K-8 Choice School, is Minnesota's Elementary School "Science and Mathematics Principal of the Year." He was selected for his work integrating cutting-edge science throughout the curriculum and revolutionizing the way his school teaches science. 
Ryan Vernosh is Minnesota's Teacher of the Year. He is a 6th grade teacher at Maxfield Magnet School in St. Paul, where he has taught since 2006. He says the two biggest issues facing education are the achievement gap and social justice. "These gaps are unacceptable and are my driving force as I prepare to teach every day." 
I salute these five great Minnesotans and all of our state's outstanding educators. They know, as I do, that better education is key to a better Minnesota. It is why I was so pleased to re-affirm last week my promise to increase state funding for public K-12 education every year I am Governor, with no excuses and no exceptions.
Our children's futures are in our hands. Their futures are our responsibility.
I ask the Legislature to follow my lead and increase state funding for K-12 education.
That doesn't mean more money to maintain the status quo. To the contrary, every additional dollar we spend on education should be directed toward improving the quality of that education.
Starting with the experiences we provide our state's children in the very first months and years of their lives.
I have been greatly impressed with the careful thought being devoted by many dedicated adults to the best use of our resources for early childhood education.
That is why I will re-establish the Governor's Council on Early Childhood Education and the Children's Cabinet, both to be led by Education Commissioner Brenda Cassellius.
This is a terrific opportunity for continued public-private partnerships, involving business leaders, foundation executives, parents, educators, and everyone else who cares about our children and their success.
Then we need to commit more state money to providing all parents with the option of affordable all-day kindergarten for their children. How can states like Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi fund all-day kindergarten, while we in Minnesota do not?
Despite our deficit, my budget will propose increased funding to expand the number of children who can receive all-day kindergarten. I ask the Legislature to help me find the additional money as soon as possible to make all-day kindergarten an option for every child in Minnesota.

In our shared desire to improve our elementary and secondary schools, our colleges, and our universities, I urge all of us to work together - instead of against one another.
For too long, teachers and other educators have been battered by continuing criticisms of their commitment, their ability, and their effectiveness. For too long, words like accountability, responsibility, and acceptable progress have been used to imply that there is none.
To say that is untrue does not mean we are satisfied with every aspect of our educational services today. It means that we are going to take a different approach to making them better.
We are going to listen to one another's concerns; we are going to work cooperatively and constructively; and we are going to enlist the best ideas from the real experts: the parents, teachers, principals, and superintendents, who are most in touch every day with our students and their needs.
As someone said, all the reform we could possibly use is available to us right now in those schools, colleges, and universities, which are educating students most successfully.
We need to identify those successes, share their strategies, and both encourage and require their use elsewhere.
I again ask every business in Minnesota to adopt a school, college, or university: to become actively involved in making them better. They will benefit from you, and you will learn from them.
Another crucial area of investment is in transportation. Minnesota suffers today from the failed legacy of twenty years of declining investments in our highways, roads, and bridges; in our public transit systems; and in other critical infrastructure. Our decline has been worse than most other states, which means we are falling further behind in what I consider one of the most important "business climate" measures: the quality and capacity of our transportation systems and other infrastructure.
It doesn't have to be that way. Look at our Metropolitan International Airport, where new investments have been made continuously during those same twenty years.
It's not perfect, but it's remarkable. Virtually an entire new airport has been constructed while continuing to operate the old one. It is rated one of the best-managed airports in the country and even the world.
Or consider the recently completed Highway 62 interchange, also built while remaining open for traffic. It's not perfect; yet it's a big improvement, and it provides for better public transit as well.
The notion we don't know how to invest in critical infrastructure improvements, or to implement those projects efficiently, is foolish. What's even more foolish, however, is our failure to make necessary investments in them. The results are deteriorating highways throughout Greater Minnesota and worsening congestion in our metro system.
Roads, highways, and public transit are to our state's economy, as are arteries to the human body.

If the arteries are healthy, and efficiently transport blood, oxygen, and nutrients throughout the body, everything works at its best. If, however, the arteries become decrepit or clogged, the body's performance suffers.
Minnesota is at a critical juncture with its transportation systems. Our investments are inadequate to maintain their condition or expand them to serve our growing population.
Their further deterioration will seriously constrict our future economic growth and damage our social vitality.
That is why I have asked Transportation Commissioner Tom Sorel to present to the Legislature his ideas for better roads, highways, and transit systems, and to begin the discussion of how best to finance them. I invite others with transportation and finance expertise in both the private and public sectors to join us in that discussion.
I ask the Legislature to consider creating a Transportation Finance Authority, chaired by the MnDOT Commissioner, to bring together the best minds and their ideas for financing the transportation improvements upon which our future social and economic vitality depend.
Third, we have to invest in the health, safety, and well-being of our citizens, our communities, and our environment.
Fortunately for all of us, there are so many Minnesotans who go to work every day to make our lives better.
I especially want to honor today the men and women who risk their lives to keep our lives safe.
Col. Eric Kerska is the Commander of the Minnesota National Guard's 1st Brigade Combat Team, 34th Infantry Division. The Red Bulls!
He will lead the 2,400 citizen soldiers of the 1st Brigade, when they deploy in May to support, for one year, Operation New Dawn, the drawdown phase of U.S. military operations in Iraq.
Col. Kerska has been a National Guardsman for over 21 years and a soldier for over 27 years. In his civilian career, he is a battalion chief for the Rochester Fire Department - a job he will put on hold while he serves his third tour of duty.
He is joined today by his wife, Tina, who is equally a Minnesota hero for her sacrifice in giving up her husband for the next year to protect our country. COLONEL ERIC and TINA KERSKA.
With us also is a family of Minnesota heroes: 1st Sergeant Gary Wenzel, his wife Cathy, and their 18 yearold son, Private First Class Todd Wenzel.
1st Sergeant Wenzel has been deployed twice. During his 18-month tour in Iraq in 2004-2005, Cathy Wenzel founded "Project Backpack," for military sons and daughters; and another organization, "Minnesota Veteran Family Support," providing families with services before, during, and after military deployment.

Today, the Wenzel's oldest son, Andrew, is on his way to Afghanistan; and Todd will be deploying with the 1st Brigade Combat Team later this spring.
PLEASE JOIN WITH ME IN PAYING TRIBUTE TO THIS EXCEPTIONAL MINNESOTA FAMILY: 1ST SERGEANT GARY, CATHY, AND PRIVATE TODD WENZEL.
Colonel Kerska and Private Wenzel, please extend to all of the 2400 men and women in your Red Bull unit our deepest gratitude for their heroic service to our state and nation, and our heartfelt prayers for all of your safe return.
Closer to home we are protected by the courageous women and men, who wear the uniforms of law enforcement officers throughout our state. We are honored today by the presence of the Police Officer of the Year, Adam Bailey.
Officer Bailey has been with the St. Paul Police for 6 years; previously he served with the St. Louis Park Police.
He was named the Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association's Police Officer of the Year for his outstanding service.
Officer Bailey has also been awarded the City of St. Paul's highest honor - the Medal of Valor - for his extraordinary heroism in the line of duty. OFFICER ADAM BAILEY.
To Officer Bailey and all the Minnesotans in uniform, who risk their lives every day and night to keep all of us safe, please accept our deepest gratitude for your dedicated and heroic service.
In addition to protecting the safety of our citizens, we must do everything possible to protect their health and well-being. The best possible and most affordable health care for all of our citizens is far too important to become a political football in the 2012 Presidential Superbowl.
Minnesota has long been a national leader in health care innovation, and our citizens everywhere have benefitted enormously from that leadership.
When my Mother was hospitalized in New York City before her passing, I learned there is no private or public hospital there, at any price, which provides a quality of care that is routine throughout Minnesota. Nor can one find the quality of doctors, nurses, and other health care providers.
Those professionals, clinics, and hospitals are absolutely priceless. All Minnesotans need and deserve access to them at the most affordable prices. We can have our honest disagreements about how best to achieve that goal.
Let us promise, however, that our disagreements will be based upon honest differences over policies, not politics.

Fourth, we need transform how we provide our citizens with the best public services, most efficiently, at the lowest cost.
This is a clear but daunting challenge: How do we improve government services and performance while we also cut costs?
Minnesota is not alone. Republican and Democratic governors and legislators across the country are grappling with this crisis.
The best of them are realizing, as my son, Eric's, business school professor told him, a crisis is a terrible thing to waste, and they are getting down to business. That is what we need to do in Minnesota.
Improving government's efficiency and service quality while reducing its cost has bipartisan support -- and leadership in both the public and private sectors. I want to thank General Mills for their support of our state's Enterprise LEAN business process improvement initiative. This initiative has improved service and cut costs; it will be expanded.
We need to do more, and we will. I want to combine the best private sector expertise with our public sector experience, to make Minnesota government the best in the world.
Our Administration will lead the way. I have asked Lt. Governor Yvonne Prettner Solon and our Chief of Staff, Tina Smith, to head this effort, along with MMB Commissioner Jim Schowalter, Administration Commissioner Spencer Cronk, and Office of Enterprise Technology Commissioner Carolyn Parnell.
I have asked them to immediately identify cost savings. For example, Minnesota has already spent $168 million in this biennium on office technology, like computers and desktop printers. Local governments spent an additional $228 million. What if we pooled our purchasing power to get a better deal for Minnesota taxpayers?
We will examine every area of expenditure and contracting to find ways to cut costs, while improving services.
Longer term, we need transformational change to improve the productivity of government, and bring it fully into the 21st century. The opportunities are huge, and the savings can be enormous.
This reform will succeed best, if we work in partnership with our state employees.
The good ideas for improvements and efficiencies often come from the people who work in government every day. Treating them with the dignity and respect they deserve will be essential to our success.
Fifth, and most important, we need our business leaders to believe in Minnesota, to invest in our state, and to create more jobs for the thousands of our citizens, who want to work.
We also need better working partnerships between our state's businesses, colleges and universities, other civic organizations, and state and local governments.

We all agree upon the need to create more jobs. Putting more people to work throughout Minnesota is essential to our economic recovery, to our social well-being, to a better future for all of us.
I am pleased to report to our fellow citizens that the Legislature and I have found areas of cooperative agreement.
We agree that our state's permitting and approval processes for new and expanding businesses have been taking unreasonably long; and we are united in our determination to shorten them, while protecting our citizens and our environment.
Two weeks ago, I signed an Executive Order to begin that streamlining process immediately. DNR Commissioner Tom Landwehr and MPCA Commissioner Paul Aasen have been working with legislative leaders of both parties to put those and other improvements into legislation.
I thank Speaker Zellers, Majority Leader Koch, and the other legislators, who are working with us to achieve this progress. May it characterize our cooperative spirit throughout the rest of the session.
I hope that we can find that same cooperative spirit to pass the statewide bonding bill, which I proposed last week.
Those investments will help build a better Minnesota for generations to come. National economists, commenting on continuing high unemployment, say a crucial factor holding back job growth is that construction has not yet revived.
That is my Bonding Bill's initial purpose: to put up to 28,000 unemployed Minnesotans in the private-sector construction industry back to work.
And, through those long-term improvements, to benefit all Minnesotans for years to come.
I want businesses everywhere in Minnesota to feel wanted, valued, and appreciated by everyone in our Administration.
I have asked the heads of our Departments of Agriculture, Natural Resources, the IRRRB, and the Tourism Office to work closely with businesses in those important industries, which are so vital to our state's prosperity, especially in Greater Minnesota.
I want to thank Jason Thormodson, an 11 year-old future farmer and mechanic from Madelia, for reminding me yesterday how very important agriculture is to our state.
DEED Commissioner Mark Phillips will have overall responsibility for our business outreach; and I have asked him to revitalize the former Star Cities for Economic Development program, which I inherited, as DEED Commissioner, from the Administration of Governor Al Quie.
Governor Quie is here today, and I want to honor him for his outstanding service to our state as our Congressman, our Governor, and our leading citizen.
His Star Cities program trained local officials, Chambers of Commerce members, college and university presidents, and other civic leaders, to work in partnership and lead their cities' economic growth efforts.
Those local economic development teams need to be better supported by state officials, and I promise that their efforts will be given the highest priority by everyone in our Administration.
I will be personally available to assist them in any way I can. I thank Representative Fabian for asking me to join him and Senator Stumpf at North Star Agri Industries' recent groundbreaking in Hallock.
I appreciate Representative Hamilton and Senator Magnus inviting me to Jackson for AgCo's exciting expansion, which will bring over 100 new jobs to our state.
I stand ready to go anywhere in our state, nation, or world where there are jobs to be gained for Minnesota, and to assist the businesses who provide them.
And I am especially grateful to our Super-Volunteer, Senior Advisor Kathy Tunheim, and my good friend, Tom Borman, who will help me reach out to Minnesota's business leaders.
Some will criticize me for proposing next week to ask those successful businessmen and women and other wealthy Minnesotans to pay higher taxes.
I ask them for their forbearance during this fiscal crisis, which I did not create, but inherited, and now, with you in the Legislature, must solve.
I ask Minnesota's business leaders and other most successful citizens to give us two years to turn this Ship of State around. Not by savaging essential public services, upon which you and your employees also depend, but rather by transforming the ways in which government operates here in Minnesota.
And, with your help, to reduce the need for those services by putting people back to work throughout our state.
My Father's favorite quote was from The Bible. "To whomsoever much has been given, of him shall much be required."
You have achieved so much. I ask you, please, to help your state, your children and grandchildren, your friends and neighbors, to regain what you and I have enjoyed so much and benefitted from so greatly during our lives here in Minnesota. Please - help us restore Minnesota to greatness.
I invite you to contribute your expertise to help us regain that greatness - at the state level, and at the county, city, township, and school district levels.
Adopt a school. Volunteer in one of them. Teach a social service agency how to become more costefficient. Help the legislature and me to balance the state's budget more wisely. Contribute your ideas, your talents, and your wisdom. We need you now more than ever.
In closing, I ask all Minnesotans for the same forbearance. I ask not to be finally judged by the budget I am required to submit next week.

I ask you to remember that I was not given a blank slate on which to write my best proposals for our state's future. Neither was the Legislature. We were left a horrendous fiscal mess, a decade of economic decline, and state agencies poorly managed.
All of that must be turned around. All of it will be turned around, but not by tomorrow, and not entirely by the end of this legislative session.
WE WILL, however, TURN IT AROUND - and move Minnesota ahead once again - to reclaim our former greatness.
I approach this monumental assignment with the utmost dedication and determination. I know Lt. Governor Prettner Solon and our exceptional Cabinet do as well.
I believe our 201 Legislators feel that same awesome responsibility.
I urge them to approach their difficult decisions, as I do, with caution and care.
We will be properly judged by effects of our decisions and actions on the lives of our fellow Minnesotans - this year, next year, and for years to come. Whether we make their lives better or worse.
Together, we must shape a strategy that will create a better Minnesota, for all of us and for all who will follow us.
We must reverse Minnesota's past decline. And return our state to a path of growth, success, and prosperity.
We can; we must; and we will.
By all of us working together. . .
To get Minnesota working again.

Mr. Speaker and Members of the MN House of Representatives.
Madam President and Members of the MN Senate.
Madam Chief Justice and Distinguished Members of the MN Supreme Court.
My fellow Constitutional Officers. Members of my staff and Cabinet.
Vice President Mondale. Governor Anderson. Other Distinguished Guests. Family and friends. My fellow Minnesotans.
My father, Bruce Dayton, is 93 years old. Sundays, we have lunch together at his home in Long Lake, where I grew up.
62 years ago, my father bought 40 acres of mostly woods and a corn field for $6000. He and my mother built a house there, and we moved into it when I was five years old. Over the years, my father acquired 130 more acres. He was the first person in Minnesota to restore his fields to their original prairie grass and flowers; and he has now donated his property to the people of Minnesota, which the DNR will preserve as one of the few remaining Òold-growthÓ forests in our state.
Last October, as we surveyed the beautiful fall colors on trees bordering his field of prairie grass, I said to him, ÒYou know, Dad, you have been a very good steward of this land. It is in so much better condition than when you bought it.Ó
I often wonder how our children and grandchildren will judge our stewardship. Will they thank us for leaving our state, nation, and world in better condition than when we inherited it? Or will they ask, ÒHow could you have left us with such a mess?Ó
The answer is for us to decide.
I am hopeful, because I believe in Minnesota. I believe in Minnesotans. And, fortunately, our state is now showing signs of a long-awaited and much-needed economic recovery. Even better, Minnesota has regained its accustomed position leading most other statesÕ economic growth, after lagging behind for much of the past decade.
MinnesotaÕs latest unemployment rate in December 2011 was 5.7%, which was a record 2.8% below the national average. While the national economy has regained less than half of the employment lost from the depth of the Great Recession, Minnesota has regained all of its lost employment. The number of employed Minnesotans today is at an all-time high. And MinnesotaÕs percentage increase in total wages during 2011 was almost 5 times greater than the rest of the country.
The 2012 State Business Tax Climate Index ranked Minnesota only 45th among the states. The top five were: Wyoming, South Dakota, Nevada, Alaska, and Florida. All, except for Alaska, are ÒRight-to-WorkÓ states.
Last month, however, MinnesotaÕs unemployment rate was lower than 4 of those 5 states. During the past two years, our growth in average hourly earnings equaled the best and beat the rest. Our per-capita income was 2nd highest.
WeÕre doing something right.
Yet, even though 97,000 more Minnesotans are working today than at the depth of the Great Recession, there are still more than 168,000 Minnesotans, who want to work, but cannot find employment.
They must be our #1 priority. So, I say to legislators, letÕs take your best ideas and my best ideas and turn them into jobs! And letÕs do it now.
I have already sent you three major jobs initiatives. My proposed bonding bill would repair buildings and upgrade classroom equipment at our state colleges and universities. It would improve our state parks. It would help finance downtown revitalization projects in several cities.
Five outstanding Mayors are with us tonight: in alphabetical order, Mayor Eric Anderson of Mankato; Mayor Ardell Brede from Rochester; St. Paul Mayor Chris Coleman; Mayor Dave Kleis of St. Cloud; and Minneapolis Mayor RT Rybak.
My father and my uncles taught me the importance of continuously improving the downtowns of our major cities. They are the economic hearts of entire regions. If the heart weakens, the rest of the body suffers.
One-third of all Minneapolis property taxes are paid by downtown enterprises. That keeps property taxes lower for everyone else in the city.
Every year, the City of Rochester and Olmsted County send almost $90 million more to the State Treasury in taxes than they receive back in LGA, School Aid, and other assistance. Why wouldnÕt we want to help make these and other key cities as successful as possible?
One national study estimates my bonding bill would create 21,700 jobs, most of them in the private sector.
If youÕre skeptical, divide by two. ThatÕs still more than 10,000 Minnesotans, now unemployed, who could be working all over the state.
Legislators, you are obviously entitled to your own preferred projects. I ask, however, that you develop your priorities quickly and pass a bonding bill this month.
The sooner you act, the sooner several thousand unemployed Minnesotans will be doing the work that those repairs and renovations require.
Pass the bonding bill, now. Please.
I have also proposed building a new ÒPeopleÕs StadiumÓ which would provide private sector jobs for several thousand more Minnesotans.
IÕm amazed that some people feel no urgency to put several thousand more Minnesotans back to work.
The legislative authors, Senator Rosen and Representative Lanning, along with Chairman Ted Mondale, have been terrific partners in this undertaking. They may be getting close to a site, a deal, and a bill. Then it will be up to you in the legislature.
Some of you reportedly want to avoid voting on a stadium until after next fallÕs elections. That would be terribly unfair to the several thousand unemployed Minnesotans, who could be working on that project this year, and to the Vikings.
Pass the Stadium Bill this session. Please.
My third jobs proposal is a ÒJobs NowÓ tax credit to encourage businesses to hire unemployed Minnesotans, Veterans, and recent college graduates. It would reduce taxes for participating businesses, while putting still more of our citizens to work.
Last week, the Minnesota National GuardÕs Adjutant General, Richard Nash, reported that of the over 3000 Minnesota Guardsmen and women presently serving in Kuwait, 22% of them will be unemployed, when they return home.
After they ALL served our country heroically, 22% of them wonÕt have jobs. That is shameful.
It is why, in addition to my ÒJobs NowÓ tax credit, I have also proposed expanding the Minnesota GI Bill to provide education benefits to all eras of veterans, because unemployment among all Minnesota veterans may be as high as twice the state average.
Sitting upstairs, are two Minnesota veterans.
Mr. Steven Jackson served in the US Army for 15 years in places like Iraq.
Mr. Jack Marshall for served 6 years in the Air Force, and did a tour in Kuwait.
These two heroes served our state and nation with great patriotism, valor, and honor. Now they canÕt find jobs. That is wrong.
So pass a ÒJobs NowÓ bill and expand the MN GI Bill. Please.
One area in which the Legislature and my Administration have worked well together is government reform. I look forward to continuing our bi-partisan collaboration in streamline permitting processes even further, reducing the costs of public services, and making them more cost-effective.
We have already made real progress. The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency and the Department of Natural Resources now complete 99% of their priority permit reviews within 150 days. We can make it still faster, and we will.
It is already paying off, however. Recently, an energy consultant asked the MN Pollution Control Agency about air permitting for a potential new business.
MPCA staff walked him through the general timelines and process. Staff also offered to meet with the company in advance to help improve the proposal and provided a pre- application checklist. This consultant said he helps businesses in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, South Carolina and California; he had never heard of another state providing this kind of service. And our 150 day turnaround seemed shorter than other states.
I also received a note from a businessman whom I met at the MN Chamber dinner. His wood products company employs 140 people in Northern Minnesota. Last year his company invested about $4 million to improve its Minnesota facility, with the possibility of another $5 million in this year. He said, ÒNone of this would have been possible without the cooperation of Commissioner Aasen and his department.Ó
DEED Commissioner PhillipsÕ ÒBusiness First-StopÓ is another step in the right direction. It is a one-stop shop, where new and expanding businesses can make one call and get whatever help they need.
Under the expert tutelage of companies like General Mills, state agencies are implementing ÒLEANÓ practices of continuous improvement, which are saving taxpayersÕ money and improving services. Commissioner Cronk and his Department of Administration saved $3 million in six months by revamping contracts with suppliers. The Department of Revenue, under Commissioner FransÕ leadership, saved $1 million by implementing electronic check processing, and greatly reduced the turn-around time for tax refunds.
At the Department of Agriculture, Commissioner Frederickson and Supervisor Harley Olinske saved taxpayers $300,000 a year, while also shortening the time for most grain and produce license renewals to less than 30 days. Mr. Olinske epitomizes the dedicated state employees, who work hard every day, and get little credit. He deserves some tonight.
Finally, Commissioner Parnell and her team are working hard to implement the legislatureÕs decision last year to consolidate the stateÕs many IT functions. Anything that gets Representatives Kahn and Downey hugging on the House floor deserves a lasting legacy, and this will have one.
The key to our future, as we all know, is education. As President Obama says, ÒWe canÕt out-compete other countries, if we donÕt out-educate them.Ó That means we must develop the best educational systems in the world.
Despite our other difficulties last session, we agreed upon many significant education innovations. We enacted an Alternative Licensure path for teachers.
We expanded Early Childhood Education, and our doing so was crucial to MinnesotaÕs winning the federal ÒRace to the TopÓ competition against 34 other states.
We established evaluation requirements for both teachers and principals. We increased the per-pupil aid formula by $50 per student in each year of this biennium, the first real increase since 2003.
We enacted ÒRead by Third Grade,Ó which will be a priceless gift to the children of Minnesota, and their parents, from a wonderful legislative leader. In fact, two outstanding leaders of improving the quality of education in Minnesota are retiring after this year: Senator Gen Olson and Representative Mindy Greiling. LetÕs pay tribute to them now.
We accomplished a great deal last year, by working together. The US Department of EducationÕs approval of our No Child Left Behind wavier, along with our afore-mentioned Race to the Top success, is testimony to their confidence in the positive direction of MinnesotaÕs education innovation. That tremendous progress is a tribute to the excellent leadership of Commissioner Cassellius and legislators of both parties.
Our challenge this year is to put all of it to work for the schoolchildren, parents, teachers, and administrators throughout Minnesota. Already, however, some legislators are advancing even more new proposals.
I have a novel idea. LetÕs develop any education initiatives this year in cooperation with teachers, rather than in conflict with them. The best education for all Minnesota students should not be a political ploy; and I will not support anything, which is.
We face similar challenges to improve our colleges and universities throughout Minnesota.
Unfortunately, unlike K-12 education, where we increased funding last session, the University of Minnesota and MnSCU were each cut by almost 15%.
The two new heads of these invaluable institutions are here tonight. Dr. Eric Kaler is the 16th President of the University of Minnesota.
Dr. Steven Rosenstone is the 4th Chancellor of the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities system.
They are joined tonight by the new Director of the Office of Higher Education, former Senator Larry Pogemiller.The three of them, together with legislators and other higher education leaders, have the enormous responsibility to retool MinnesotaÕs colleges and universities and give their students the crucial advantages needed to succeed in this highly competitive global economy.
WeÕre told that by 2018, 70% of MinnesotaÕs jobs will require some kind of postsecondary degree.
ThatÕs just the beginning, however; not the end. Our postsecondary students need more than degrees; they need the worldÕs best educations -- so they can thrive in that world. And Minnesota will not thrive, unless they do.
Chancellor Rosenstone and President Kaler need our support to make all of their campuses excellent. Their curricula and classrooms must be world-class and state-of-the-art.
They must prepare their students for the jobs of the future, not the past.
ItÕs already happening in many classrooms on U of M and MnSCU campuses. Mr. Ron Ulseth is an instructor at Itasca Community College. He developed the program ÒIron Range Engineering,Ó a hands-on learning experience, where students do real engineering work for Minnesota companies.
ItÕs so successful that the Engineering Department at Stanford University invited him there to teach their faculty about the benefits of this new model. When ÒIron Range EngineeringÓ meets Silicon Valley -- well, Ron, I just hope you have a share of the royalties!
Antoinette McCarthy is another wonderful success story. She said, ÒI had tried college before, but I wasnÕt as successful as I had hoped.Ó As a result, she struggled to find a decent-paying job and a career with a future.
Now, Antoinette is poised for success. She just completed a FastTRAC program at Inver Hills Community College, receiving her Certificate as a Nursing Assistant.
Her hard work for that certificate means she will earn, on average, nearly double what someone would at a minimum-wage medical job.
We need FastTRAC on every campus in Minnesota. We need state and federal job training and workforce development monies to be better coordinated with higher education funding and programs, so that all of our students come out of our educational systems, skilled and ready to succeed. The success of our state depends upon it.
Another prerequisite for our children and grandchildrenÕs future success is for us to restore fiscal responsibility to Minnesota government.
Last year, legislators, who voted for the final budget bills, and I increased borrowing from our schools by $750 million and borrowing from our future by another $750 million. $1.5 billion in additional debt should put our so-called $876 million surplus in perspective.
If my final tax proposal, to raise income taxes on only the wealthiest 2% of Minnesotans had been accepted, not only would this bienniumÕs budget have been balanced and that $1.5 billion of additional borrowing unnecessary; but also the current budget forecast for the next biennium would show a surplus, rather than a $1.3 billion deficit.
In fairness, I acknowledge that many of you in the legislature wanted to balance the budget by reducing spending.
Next November, Minnesotans will decide which of our approaches they prefer. Until then, let us resolve that we will conduct this sessionÕs financial affairs responsibly.
No more borrowing.
As stewards of the public trust, I ask us to leave one final legacy to future generations of Minnesotans. Our wonderful State Capitol building is wearing down and falling apart. We can either wait until someone is seriously injured or worse, when the public outcry will compel action; or we can act now.
I am asking you Legislators to make the most unselfish vote of your careers: to kick yourselves, me, and everyone else out of the Capitol, as needed, for the four years necessary to renovate this building, and to make it both functional and safe for the next 100 years. It will be hard on all of us Ð but so much better for those who follow us. That is the essence of selfless stewardship. And it epitomizes the kind of legacy for which our children and grandchildren will be grateful.
When this magnificent Capitol opened in 1905, Minnesota was a very different state. And not nearly as successful.
Our citizensÕ per-capita income was below the rest of the countryÕs, and it dropped to only 85% of the national average by 1920. There it floundered for the next 25 years, before beginning a gradual climb to parity with the rest of the country in the 1960Õs, rising above the national average in the 1970Õs, and continuing to improve thereafter.
So how did Minnesota become above average? The President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis recently noted, as have others, that the number of educated people in our stateÕs labor force is higher than in the nation; therefore their productivity and their work quality are better.
MinnPostÕs Louis Johnston attributes our success to high rates of labor force participation, especially by women; our greater investments in human capital, such as education and health care; and both public sector and private sector investments in physical capital.
As we strive to improve our state for ourselves and for our descendants, let us not forget what has lifted us from below average to above average to outstanding. LetÕs not destroy good wages and benefits; damage our schools, colleges and universities; or curtail our capital investments, in search of another strategy of unproven value.
Or one of proven less value.
Minnesota is a remarkable state. Our people, our businesses, our non-profits, and our governments have worked well together to achieve a standard of living and quality of life, which surpass most. Both DFL and Republican governors and legislators have contributed to that success.
Let us, please, build upon what has been done before us, not tear it down. Minnesotans want more efficient government; they want better services. And they want us to cooperate and compromise in order to deliver them.
I stand ready to work with legislators on both sides of the aisle to enact laws that will better Minnesota.
They will be the bills, which have involved members of my administration and legislators from both parties in their development.
Those bills I will support.
I am not interested in highly partisan, extreme measures, which are intended for campaign literature, rather than law.
Those bills I will not support.
President John F. Kennedy, in his book, Profiles in Courage, wrote:
ÒIt is compromise that prevents each set of reformers from crushing the group on the other end of the political spectrum. The fanatics and extremists are always disappointed at the failure of their government to rush to implement all of their principles and to denounce those of their opponents. But the legislator knows that there are few, if any, issues where all the truth and all the right and all the angels are on one side.Ó
If we cooperate, if we share our best ideas, if we exchange our rigid ideologies for our shared ideals, we will revitalize our state. And we will be doing the jobs the people of Minnesota sent us here to do.
Only by working together can we achieve a lasting legacy, in which we Ð and they Ð can take pride.
May God Bless the State of Minnesota and the United States of America.In a State of the State Address, as in life, it's important to assess where we are, remember how we got here, decide where we want to go, and then determine how best to get there.
Comparing the state of our state today with conditions, when I took office two years ago, we have made important progress. We have much more work still ahead of us; however, we are on the way to a better Minnesota.
According to our Department of Employment and Economic Development, there are over 72,000 more jobs available in Minnesota today than when I took office two years ago. Almost 52,000 of those jobs were added in the past year.
Minnesota's job growth in 2012 was the 12th best among all 50 states; and we outperformed three of our four neighbors. Iowa ranked 30th best; South Dakota was 44th.
Wisconsin, which by the way is open for business, helped bring up the rear at 42nd. And, help spread the word across the St. Croix, their unemployment rate last month was 20% higher than ours, while our per capita income was 12% higher than theirs.
Only North Dakota, in the Upper Midwest, topped us in job growth last year, and their percent increase led the nation.
Our exports of agricultural commodities increased by 13 percent in 2012, compared with 2011. Total exports of all Minnesota goods and services have achieved eight straight quarters of record growth.
Our students' educational attainments have improved. Math scores for all tested grades, improved by 5.3 percent from 2011 to 2012, and reading scores improved overall by 1.3 percent.
We have, and continue to, lead the nation in important measures of health, including the lowest heart disease death rate, and the lowest percentage of obese or overweight children. We have the second longest life expectancy for all our citizens, and we're #1 for males.
I'll let Health Commissioner Ehlinger explain that discrepancy, and I expect that Representative Kahn will soon have a bill to correct it.
Last year, we eliminated premiums and expanded health care access for 16,000 more Minnesota children; and we were recognized for providing the Best Long Term Care Services in the nation by the AARP Commonwealth Fund.

No one should be satisfied, or complacent. However, these and many other improvements are encouraging.
We have also made great progress in restoring fiscal responsibility and operational integrity to Minnesota government, which also tells us a lot about what got us to where we are today.
I became Governor after a decade of deficits in both our federal and state governments. They squandered their positions of financial stability amidst consistent economic growth, which they enjoyed at the beginning of the 21st century, and which were then projected to continue for at least the next decade.
Few politicians can resist the opportunity to cut taxes. President Bush proposed two large tax cuts in 2001 and 2003, which I opposed as a Senator and Congress passed. In Minnesota, Governor Ventura convinced the legislature to reduce income tax rates in both 1999 and 2000. Both leaders assumed that the strong economic growth during the last half of the 1990's would continue. Unfortunately, both were wrong.
Also wrong were the politicians and economists, who promised that cutting taxes would lead to more economic growth, jobs, and revenues. Instead, the two federal tax cuts were soon followed by two recessions, the second the most severe since the Great Depression.
In the decade after Minnesota's income tax reductions, our economy fared worse than the nation and most other states. And at both the federal and state levels, big tax cuts followed by serious recessions produced large budget deficits, which threaten our current fiscal strength and future economic prosperity.
The solutions to those deficits were very clear. However, they were also very painful; so they were postponed, then postponed again, and again. Unfortunately, avoiding financial problems usually makes them worse. Fixing them then becomes even harder.
Thus, when I became Governor in January 2011, the State Budget Forecast projected a $6 billion deficit for the next two fiscal years. It took six months of difficult negotiations with the Republican-controlled legislature to finally agree upon a balanced budget.
Those decisions were hard for all of us and far more painful for all the Minnesotans denied needed services and assistance. But we had to enact a balanced budget, and we did.
Since then, an improving state economy and savings from health care reforms have boosted our finances by $2.5 billion for this biennium, enabling us to restore our reserves and repay over 60 percent of the previous school shifts.
We have repaired much of the fiscal damage we inherited, but we're not done yet. We face another deficit, projected at $1.1 billion, for the next biennium; and we still owe our schools another $1.1 billion.

My budget for the next biennium would lift us out of this miserable deficit-to-deficit cycle. It would eliminate the $1.1 billion deficit, balance the biennial budget, and begin the following biennium with a projected surplus that would enable us to pay back the remainder of the school shift.
My proposals have already aroused considerable controversy. Such debate is healthy in our democracy.
The genius of our system of governance is that no one gets to have it all her or his way. Starting with the governor.
Some will characterize any legislative changes in my budget as my loss. I don't see it that way, at all. The winners I care about are the people of Minnesota, whose collective best interests I was elected to represent. As were you in the legislature. Whatever outcome does the most to improve the lives of the most Minnesotans, makes winners of us all.
However, before we refocus on that controversy, I think we should look farther ahead. Former Governor Arne Carlson liked to say, "If you don't know where you're going, any road will take you there." I appreciate that wisdom more every year.
Where do we want to go? Where do we want Minnesota to be in a year, in a decade, or more? We will not agree on every aspect. However, if we can discover our shared goals, perhaps we will find greater accord on how best to achieve them. We can also better assess whether the path we're now on will lead us to them.
This perspective also broadens the time horizon of our decision-making. We must consider not only what is right for Minnesota today, but also what is best for Minnesota in the future.
So, what do I believe offers the best hope for a better future to most Minnesotans? I want Minnesota to provide the best jobs for our citizens, the best lives for their families, and the best environment for our businesses to provide those jobs.
Those who measure "business climate" only by tax rankings will question my strategy, although many surveys rate Minnesota lower in overall taxes than most are led to believe. We're 15th among the states in taxes, according to the Minnesota Center for Fiscal Excellence. And we rank 11th highest in per capita income.
However, Minnesota has not been considered a "low tax" state during my almost four decades of public service. And the facts show that states offering businesses and their top executives the lowest taxes usually offer the rest of their citizens the lowest incomes, the fewest public services, and the highest crime rates.
Furthermore, their job growth typically lags "high value and high performance" states like Minnesota.

So, yes, I absolutely meant what I said. I want Minnesota to provide the best jobs for our citizens, the best lives for their families, and the best support for our businesses to provide those jobs. I want Minnesota state government to provide the best value for everyone's hard-earned tax dollars and the most efficient, effective services anywhere.
I want Minnesota to offer the world's best educations for ALL of our citizens, children and grandchildren. Educations which begin early in life, and continue throughout life; so that all of us can learn the skills, and relearn the new skills, necessary to succeed in a rapidly changing and ever-more-competitive global economy.
We know that our exceptional citizens, who are more inventive, harder working, and more productive than people anywhere, have been the most important contributors to our state's economic progress and social vitality. Most of us agree that our citizens' superior educations have been crucial to our previous successes.
And many of us agree that providing all Minnesotans with the best, most advanced, and yet affordable educational opportunities will be even more essential to their future success, and thus to ours.
I will return shortly to consider whether we are on a path toward that goal.
I want all of us, and especially Minnesota's future generations, to live in a healthy environment; in safe, inclusive communities; and with the same rights and protections as every other American citizen.
A healthy life starts with, and depends upon, clean air to breathe, clean water to drink, protected natural environments to enjoy, and a secure ecological future. No one can endure the severe droughts or floods of recent years; endure (or, some, enjoy) our milder, snow-scarce winters; lather on sunscreen to walk outdoors without being greatly alarmed.

If you're not, talk with my good friend and world-premier polar explorer, Will Steger, who is here tonight, about the drastic climate changes he has witnessed.
Even more alarming is that our state and our nation are still not doing enough to reverse this path toward global catastrophe, before it is too late.

In Minnesota, we have made real progress in areas like energy conservation, more efficient farming and manufacturing practices, and the development and use of clean, renewable energy, especially wind energy, instead of polluting fossil fuels.
The question is: are we progressing fast enough? Are we doing all we can to utilize other renewables, such as solar, and also to make Minnesota the best place to locate these new industries and their jobs?
Many of you, who served in previous legislatures, deserve great credit for your pioneering work to expand our use of clean energy, including Lieutenant Governor Yvonne Prettner Solon and former Senator Ellen Anderson, who is also here tonight.
I challenge this legislature to work again with our state's visionary clean energy advocates, large energy providers, large energy users, other stakeholders, and my administration to use your past achievements as springboards for Minnesota's next big leap toward a sustainable energy future.
Safe, inclusive communities benefit all Minnesotans. Doing everything possible to stop the terrible acts of violence, which end young lives and victimize innocent people, should be an urgent priority for all of us.
Those strategies deserve and require more time than I have available tonight. Let me focus on one initiative, however, and enlist everyone's support.
Studies show that the highest incidences of juvenile delinquency and teenage pregnancy occur during the weekday hours after school. Years ago, there were more organized, supervised afterschool programs for young people. The ones remaining do exceptional work; but there are not enough of them, and they struggle to find the funding to continue.
Two years ago, I challenged businesses to "Adopt a School." Some businesses, to their great credit, were already involved in improving our schools, and others accepted my challenge.
Some, however, especially smaller businesses have told me it was just too big an assignment to adopt an entire school.
So, I invite you to "Adopt an After-School Program." It might involve a financial contribution, the donation of new or used equipment, or your employees as part-time volunteers. There are so many from which to choose, and so many young people who need better options than unoccupied time, streets, and gangs.
In the coming weeks, we will be releasing more information on how you can help. In the meantime, if you need help finding a worthy program, give me a call. I believe most of you have my home phone number by now. If not, it's 651-201-3468.
For the next two weeks, however, I'm taking calls at home only from "Adopt an After-School Program" volunteers. On anything else, please call my office, at 651-201-3499.

Let me mention one other cause, which is controversial, but consistent with my faith and my principles. And, more importantly, consistent with this country's founding principles and its Constitution. I believe that every Minnesotan should have the freedom to marry legally the person she or he loves, whether of the same or other sex.
Last year, Minnesotans began a conversation about why marriage matters, and we found our common belief that it is about love, commitment, and responsibility. I want Minnesota to be a state, which affirms that freedom for one means freedom for everyone, and where no one is told it is illegal to marry the person you love.

I realize now that I could fill the rest of the evening, and most of tomorrow morning, with my goals for "A Better Minnesota." I doubt that anyone wants to sit here for that long, and we're not set up to serve breakfast!
Many of my goals, however, are contained in my budget for the next biennium, along with new and continuing strategies to help us attain them. My budget addresses two over-riding imperatives: First, to erase a $1.1 billion deficit and balance the rest of it, while continuing to

improve the efficiency and quality of state services; and Second, to make the investments necessary to move Minnesota ahead.
How does it meet the first requirement? The old-fashioned way: by decreasing spending, enacting cost-saving reforms and raising revenues. My budget is balanced, fair and honest-- there are no gimmicks, no games.
I reduce projected state spending, while increasing investments in more jobs and better education. I continue our significant progress in improving the quality and the efficiency of state services.
And I raise revenues responsibly for the first time in many years, while also making our tax structure fairer for hard-working, middle-income Minnesotans.
My budget would reduce overall state spending for the next biennium by $1.8 billion below what was projected, when I took office in 2011. Back then, the State Budget Forecast predicted that laws enacted by the previous governor and legislature would result in expenditures of almost $39.7 billion during Fiscal Years 2014 and 2015. My current budget proposes spending $37.9 billion in that biennium, $1.8 billion less than originally forecasted.
That's worth repeating. My proposed budget for the next biennium would spend $1.8 billion less than was forecasted for those two years, when I took office.
Those who criticize my supposed lack of spending reductions evidently do not understand that many of the $2 billion cuts we made two years ago for the current biennium were permanent; and lowered spending by $2.5 billion in the next biennium, before I made my new proposals.
Take state funding for higher education, for example, which comprises the University of Minnesota, the MnSCU system, and student financial aid. Facing an overall $6 billion deficit, the 2011 legislature and I had to cut state support for higher education by 12 percent, to 2 billion, 568 million dollars.
Last November's Budget Forecast assumed the next biennium's expenditures for higher education would be the same as in the current biennium. Take a look. There are no spending increases for higher education; so, the previous 12 percent cut would continue into the next one.
However, that significant cut is only the latest reduction in state support for higher education. Last weekend, I searched the Department of Management & Budget's computerized archives, looking for a previous biennium, when the State of Minnesota spent less money, in real dollars, to support higher education.
I couldn't find one in records, which go back to the 1996/1997 biennium. I did learn that in real dollars, our state spends $569 million less on higher education in the current biennium, than we did 16 years ago.

I asked the MMB staff to look back even further, into the paper records. They found that the last time we actually spent less to support higher education, in real dollars, than we are in FY12-13 ... was in FY80-81.
I'll say it again. In every biennium since FY80-81, real state spending for all of postsecondary education has been higher than it is today.
My budget would add $240 million in higher ed. funding for the next biennium. That counts as spending increase, which, technically, it is. However, it falls over $100 million short of restoring the funding cut from FY10/11; and it still leaves state support for higher education hundreds of million dollars below the real levels 20 and even 30 years ago.
No wonder the most recent comparison of the 50 states by their expenditures for higher education per $1000 of personal income ranked Minnesota only 32nd. And no wonder tuitions keep rising, making a Minnesota college education less and less affordable for students and their families.
How much lower will we reduce our spending for postsecondary education, either in real dollars or compared to other states? Experts everywhere say that the quality and affordability of higher education is key to our future economic success. Does anyone believe that continuing to reduce our commitment to higher education is the path to a Better Minnesota?
Analyzing other areas of state government spending yields similar results. During the past decade, our state leaders reduced expenditures for many public services, both in real dollars and in comparison to other states. The latest survey places Minnesota 33rd among the states in total expenditures for K-12 education per $1000 of personal income; 37th for health and hospitals; 19th for police protection; and 48th for fighting fires.
Are we better off today after all those reductions in public services? I say, "No." Trying to cut our way to a Better Minnesota is a failed experiment.
That is why my budget takes a balanced approach. Real spending cuts are partly offset by responsible increases, mostly for better education from early childhood through post-secondary and for job creation incentives. Both are critical to assuring future economic opportunities and enhancing our quality of life.
Overall spending reductions and selective increases are one part of my balanced approach to eliminating the deficit, balancing the budget, and moving Minnesota ahead. Another important strategy is to expand the significant reforms, which my administration has made during its first two years in reducing the costs of services and improving their efficiencies.
We have instituted more reforms and achieved greater progress during our first two years than in all of the previous eight years. I will briefly mention just a few.
Today, Minnesota has retaken its rightful place as a national leader in health care reform. The cost of providing health care for increasing numbers of our citizens has, for years, been the most rapidly growing part of our state budget, as is true for virtually every other state. Curbing those cost increases, while expanding quality and affordable health care to all of our citizens, is crucial.
Our Department of Human Services contracts with managed care providers and insurance companies for most of its health care services. Thus our first target for reform was the way the state had previously contracted for those services; and we have already achieved significant cost savings.
Commissioner Lucinda Jesson's tremendous success in negotiating a 1 percent profit cap on existing contracts and putting the largest new contracts out for competitive bids, have saved state and federal taxpayers over $1 billion.
Our reforms do not stop there. My new budget proposes a comprehensive redesign of the fastest growing part of our HHS budget, our long term care system. By providing more choices to keep seniors and people with disabilities in their homes, with better care, we save $151 million in the short term. More importantly, we will have built a system that is financially sustainable when the age wave descends upon Minnesota starting in 2020.
Last week, we announced yet another reform measure that will change how the state pays for public health insurance, providing better care for 100,000 Minnesotans, and saving taxpayers an estimated $90 million.
Finally, Minnesota is one of the leading states in implementing this country's sweeping and farreaching reform of providing and paying for health care.
Over the next two years, our public programs will provide health care to an additional 145,000 poor Minnesotans who do not have insurance today. These are people who otherwise access care through costly emergency room visits, harming their health and driving up the price of health care for all of us.
And through the creation of a Minnesota Insurance Exchange, we will enable individuals, families, and businesses to make more informed decisions about good, affordable health care coverage.
In education, we have worked with DFL and Republican legislators, business executives, and other civic leaders to establish state support for early childhood learning programs, a quality rating system, and scholarships for low-income children.
My new budget would expand significantly early learning opportunities for children statewide. My proposal to provide state funds for optional all-day kindergarten would provide a continuum of learning from early childhood into first grade and beyond.
Two years ago, we worked with the legislature to make administrative and legislative reforms that streamlined businesses' permit application processes. We shortened the time taken by the Pollution Control Agency, to review permit applications to a maximum of 150 days, for all but the largest projects. We are now progressing toward the next goal of reducing those timelines to 90 days.
We're not done reforming. In fact, we're just getting started. Back in 1998, when I first ran for Governor, a campaign that most people have forgotten and I would like to, there was a television commercial for the soft-drink Seven-Up. Contrasting itself to Coke and Pepsi, it proudly called itself the "un-cola."
In my campaign, I proposed making an even-year legislative session "The Unsession." Except for responding to a fiscal or other emergency and passing a bonding bill, the session would be devoted to eliminating unnecessary or redundant laws, rules, and regulations; reducing the verbiage in those that remain; shortening the timelines for developing and implementing them; and undoing anything else, which makes government nearly impossible to understand, operate, or support.
I suggest making next year's legislative session the first "Unsession." After this session is concluded ... on time, in May ... I will ask my agency heads and legislative staff to begin making lists, checking them twice, and working with any legislators, other public officials, and citizens, who wish to spearhead these reforms.
The third component of my balanced budget approach raises state revenues, which will be necessary to eliminate the deficit and still prevent further reductions in the services and assistance that many Minnesotans need.
Raising revenues requires asking someone to pay more taxes. Making taxes fairer requires asking more of those citizens and corporations, who now pay less than their proportionate share.
Few people like paying taxes, even when they're fair. No one likes paying more taxes, even when necessary to make them fair.
But when taxes are unfair ... and remain unfair, not only do the people who are forced to pay more, rightfully resent it; but they also lose faith in their elected officials, who won't change it. Today, more and more hard-working, middle-class Minnesotans believe that the state's tax structure is unfair to them.

And they're right. The facts compiled by the nonpartisan staff at the Minnesota Department of Revenue show that the richest Minnesotans pay less of their incomes in state and local taxes than most other Minnesotans. Large multi-national corporations headquartered here admit their effective tax rates are well below the 9.8% paid by many smaller businesses.
Thanks to the excellent work of Minnesota 2020, I recently became aware of a new study, by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, which confirms the Department of Revenue's analysis. It found that middle-class Minnesotans pay 26 percent more state and local taxes per dollar of income than do the top one percent of our state's income earners.
When people who have the most pay the least, this state and nation are in trouble. When lobbyists protect tax favors for special interests at the cost of everyone else's best interests, this state and nation are in trouble. My goal is to get us out of trouble.
As I see it, we have three basic budget options.
Plan A is the one I have proposed, or something close to it.
Plan B is to stick with our current tax structure, or something close to it.
Plan C is something better. No one would be happier than me to see a good Plan C. I'm still looking and I'm sure listening. But without one, our choices are between Plans A and B.
Let me briefly address some of my concerns with Plan B, sticking with the status quo. Most of us want stability and certainty in our lives. When confronted with the need for change and its resulting uncertainties, it's human nature to hunker down, hang on, and hope that the established order will return.
Today's reality, however, is that the old order doesn't show any signs coming back. Our state and our nation are engulfed by the new, global economy. We either act now to move ahead, or let ourselves fall behind.
Retaining the current tax structure doesn't even solve our current budget problems; much less advance our state to a better future. It still leaves a $1.1 billion deficit, which I insist must be resolved through honest, responsible measures. It leaves important services severely cut. And it leaves us unable to make the new investments, especially in jobs, economic growth, and education that I believe are essential to a Better Minnesota.
I have a respectful, but strong, disagreement with some of the other elected officials here tonight, about the value of public investments in, and incentives for, economic growth. My father and uncles taught me the paramount importance of continuous private and public investments in improving the communities in which people work and live. In my job, I apply that principle to the "community" of Minnesota.
For two years, my proposals to make capital investments in the downtowns of major cities, like St. Paul, Duluth, Rochester, Mankato, and St. Cloud, and investments in smaller, but equally essential projects throughout Minnesota were rejected by Republican legislative leaders.
Despite a lagging construction industry and good Minnesotans in the building trades unable to find work, they just said No.
Well, just saying No just won't work ... not in Rochester, where the renowned Mayo Clinic wants us to help them continue to outclass their competitors in other states and other countries ... and to continue doing so from Rochester. I thank Mayo, whose CEO Dr. John Noseworthy is with us tonight as a guest of Speaker Thissen, for giving Minnesota this chance to partner with them and help assure their world medical pre-eminence for decades to come ... in Rochester, Minnesota.
Our vitally important agriculture economy is crucial to our state's future. We cannot afford NOT to keep making new investments to support innovation, new production efficiencies, and even greater prosperity. That is why state funding for the Agricultural Growth, Research, and Innovation Program must remain a high priority
I have shared with University of Minnesota President Eric Kaler, who is here this evening, my high priority to return the University's Medical School to the national prominence it has previously achieved; and he has told me that he shares that goal. That turnaround, however, will require public investments.
I have talked with MnSCU Chancellor Rosenstone about the critical importance of his campuses retooling their programs to prepare their students for the jobs of the future. I know that the Chancellor is addressing this imperative. However, revising curricula, modernizing equipment, and upgrading technology all will require public investments.
And I have not even mentioned tonight ... nor does my budget address ... the critical need to invest in improving our highways, roads, and bridges statewide; our public transit systems; our ageing infrastructure; and the list goes on.
We can choose, as others in our positions have before us, to ignore these growing problems, avoid fixing them, and hope they don't crash down upon us, while we're in office.

Or, we can lead. That is what the people of Minnesota elected us to do. That is what they need us to do.
They need us to lead our state forward. Not back to failed ideologies of the past, now masquerading in new jargon. Not remaining locked into what might have worked in the past; but is faltering now, and will likely fail in the future.

It is an awesome responsibility to know that Minnesota's future will depend, in part, on the choices that we are called upon to make.
Those choices will not be easy; and some of them will not be popular. But it is time to prove that Minnesota's leaders are capable of more than ideological skirmishes and political stalemates, which offend our state's citizens and jeopardize our state's future.
This is our time and our responsibility ... to work together and build a state that works.
So, if you're coming to this State Capitol during the next four months, bring your best ideas and your sincere convictions. Bring your work boots and your hard hats. If you're interested in nothing more than throwing rocks and casting blame, send the rest of us a letter ... or a postcard.
But if you really want to pitch in, all the way in, even sacrifice a little of your self-interest for everyone's better interests ... welcome. We need you. Your state needs you.
And please remember always. You're here to serve the best interests of all the people of Minnesota. Not just your clients. Not just your constituents. Not just the people, who agree with you. Or who agree with me.
You are here. I am here. We are all here ... to serve All of Minnesota. To serve the cause of a Better Minnesota.
So, let us begin.

When I ran for Governor four years ago, I promised "A Better Minnesota." Tonight, I can report that the state of our State is better - much better -- than before. It's better for us, and it's better for those who will inherit it from us. But the economic growth and social progress we have achieved, also reminds us of the work we still have left to do.
Becoming a parent introduces a longer-term perspective. We begin to consider the effects of our actions not only on our own lives, but also on lives that will extend beyond ours.
Becoming a grandparent, as I did a year-ago, thanks to my terrific son and wonderful daughterin-law, Eric and Cory Dayton, who are in the gallery tonight, adds another generation to that timeline. It also raises the stakes.
Somewhere down the road, my grandson and his generation will assess the state of the state we have left to them. They will decide whether we, through our actions or inactions, made their lives better. Let's keep them in mind, as we choose our state's path.
In my first State of the State, three years ago, I said, "I know what we must do to create that better future for all of us. To progress, we have to invest.
"We have to invest in more jobs. Invest in better education. In improved transportation. In the health of our citizens, our communities, and our environment. In the transformation of government services."
In other words, we have to invest in growth, quality, and effectiveness.

Well, we invested in jobs. Minnesota's private sector and public sector both invested in jobs. We are blessed with so many outstanding businesses, located everywhere in our state, operating everywhere in the world - and who, during the past three years, rediscovered that they can be successful and profitable here in Minnesota. As a result, we have the 5th fastest growing economy in the country.
There are more than 2.8 million jobs in Minnesota today. More jobs than ever before in our state's history. 150,000 more jobs than when I became Governor three years ago.
This economic growth is happening all over our state. A recent newspaper story was entitled, "Lots of jobs find a home on the prairie in southwestern Minnesota." It said that, for example, Jackson County reported a 5 percent increase in jobs during 2013. The City of Jackson's economic development coordinator is quoted saying that, "Everybody who is able to work, and willing, is probably employed."
Jackson's largest employer, AGCO, has doubled its workforce to more than 1,300. Nearby, HitchDoc, which manufactures automotive and farm equipment for 300 customers, has grown from a dozen employees to 140. "And I'm looking for another 30," said the company's owner, Brad Mohns. "I'm turning down work, because I can't find enough employees."
Some people believe there is no role for government in private sector expansion and job creation. To see that they're mistaken, just look around Minnesota.
There would not be a new stadium under construction in Minneapolis without the financial support of the City and the State of Minnesota. 7500 construction workers will have jobs building that stadium over the next couple years. Over one-third of them will be people of color.
Located right next to the stadium will be a $400 million private sector development, the largest in a generation. It will provide office space for 5000 Wells Fargo employees, residential apartments, stores and shops, a hotel, and a new, two-block public park. Its construction will employ another 1000 Minnesotans. And that is just the beginning of the area's revitalization.
Another new stadium is being constructed in downtown St. Paul. It would not have occurred without an investment by that City and the State of Minnesota. It will anchor the resurgence of the Lowertown Neighborhood in our Capitol City.
Perhaps the most transformative development project anywhere will occur in Rochester, thanks to the world-renowned Mayo Clinic's decision to build its expanded Destination Medical Center there. Already Minnesota's largest private employer, Mayo expects this multi-billion dollar expansion to double its employment over the next twenty years. The Center will be surrounded by new hotels, restaurants, stores, and recreational opportunities.
This project will enhance Rochester's standing, as the premier health care center in the world. It will establish Minnesota as one of the world's best locations for advanced medical research; the development of new medical treatments and technologies; and the thousands of good new jobs they will create. This project would not be happening without Mayo's extraordinary commitment. It would not be happening here in Minnesota without the significant state investment approved by the legislature last year, along with investments by the City of Rochester and Olmsted County.
There are many more successes. Segetis in Hoyt Lakes, Price Mechanical in Maple Grove, AXIS Clinicals in Dilworth, Viracon in Owatonna, Shutterfly in Shakopee, AAR Corporation in Duluth, Toro in Bloomington, Baxter in Brooklyn Park, WFSI in Sauk Rapids, and 3M in Maplewood, all located or expanded their businesses and created jobs all over Minnesota, partly as a result of their financial partnerships with the state and local governments.
There will be many more, if we are smart enough to continue making those investments. But there won't be as many, if we are not.

To illustrate, let's go to Luverne and Worthington, right next to the South Dakota and Iowa borders.
Both cities report opportunities to expand existing businesses and attract new ones. However, they desperately need more water. Without it, business growth is being stifled, new jobs are being lost, and residents are being forced to buy bottled water. Meanwhile, the solution to their water problems, the Lewis & Clark pipeline, is stalled at the Minnesota-South Dakota border, due to lack of public investment.
The federal government has essentially bailed on the project, despite the strenuous efforts of our Minnesota Congressional Delegation. The $71 million needed to complete the pipeline's Minnesota leg must come mostly from us, or that region's growth in population, businesses, and jobs will suffer.
The harsh reality is that there is probably not enough room in an $850 million bonding bill to fund the pipeline's construction all the way through Luverne, into Worthington, and on to the Iowa border. However, there could well be enough room in a larger bonding bill to complete the Minnesota segment and turn the water on in Luverne and Worthington. Otherwise, they will have to wait at least until the next bonding bill, one or two years from now.
Why am I for a $1.2 Billion bonding bill? Because I'm for jobs. Our building this pipeline means jobs now and more jobs in the future. It means this region of our state will have the opportunity to grow and to prosper. Isn't that a purpose we can all support? I hope so.
There are other cities throughout Minnesota, which need the state's financial support to complete key projects that will bring them new businesses, new jobs, new people, and new economic growth. Those job-creating projects will either be funded in this year's bonding bill, or they will lose out again. That decision is yours in the legislature.

Improving education is closely connected with good jobs and economic growth. It is also closely connected with our citizens' health and well-being. I am very pleased to report that we have made significant new investments in education, all the way from early childhood through postsecondary, and improved results are beginning to show.
We started in 2011, when, despite facing a projected $6 Billion deficit, we increased K-12 education funding by $223 million, reversing a decade of declining state support for our public schools.
The 2011 legislature also passed an Alternative Pathway for Teacher Licensure and a "Read Well by Third Grade" literacy initiative. It enacted comprehensive teacher and principal evaluations. Principal evaluations began last fall, and teacher evaluations will start state-wide this September.

Last year, the 2013 legislature made $485 million of new investments in education. It increased the per-pupil aid formula as well as support for Special Education. State funding for early childhood education scholarships was increased to $46 million last year, and the Senate wants to raise that amount this year. Early childhood education is real education reform.
The legislature also passed one of my consistent priorities; and state-funded, all-day kindergarten will begin this fall. Studies show that both early childhood and all-day kindergarten can make crucial differences in boosting students' performances and closing achievement gaps. So do nutritious hot school lunches. No child should be shamed because parents can't afford lunch. Hopefully, that funding will soon be enacted.
And, very significantly, during the past two-and-a-half years, we have repaid ALL of the $2.8 Billion previously borrowed from our schools. Now, school districts can put their money into classrooms, not bank loans. Let us vow that no more will we balance state budgets by creating deficits in school budgets.
Just weeks ago, the legislature passed strong anti-bullying legislation. That is also important education reform. Children don't learn at school, if they are scared. Or made to feel bad about themselves.
Once, Minnesota students competed successfully not only with students around the country, but also with kids around the world. We are on our way to doing that again.
Testing by the Trends in International Math and Science Study ranks Minnesota #9 among world educational systems in Science and 6th in Mathematics.
Back home, in the most recent National Assessment of Educational Progress testing, Minnesota's 4th graders tested #1 in the nation in math. They ranked 10th best in reading, which was a big improvement from 22nd the year before. Very important was that the state's reading gap for African-American and Latino 4th graders closed by 10 points from 2009 to 2013.
Our 8th graders ranked 11th best in the nation in reading and 5th best in math.
We have had the highest ACT scores among seniors for 8 years running, and our graduation rate, nearly 80%, is the highest in a decade.
Regarding higher education, we have started to make progress, but we have quite a ways to go. In fiscal 2012, state support for higher education, in real, after-inflation dollars, fell to its lowest level since 1981. Last year's legislature began to reverse that trend, and increased state funding for higher education by a record $248.5 million.
One result from that declining state funding had been the increased reliance on tuition revenues to fund our public colleges and universities. According to the College Board, in this school year

Minnesota has the 4th highest in-state tuition and fees for two-year public colleges and the 12th highest for four-year colleges and universities. Last year's legislature wisely imposed two-year freezes on tuitions at the University of Minnesota and the MnSCU colleges and universities.
In addition, the State Grant Program was expanded. As a result, over Minnesota 100,000 students have received increased state financial aid this year.

Improved transportation is also essential to support economic growth and a Better Minnesota. Unfortunately, Minnesota's highways, roads, bridges, and public transit systems have been underfunded for the past quarter-century. Federal funds, state gas tax revenues, license fees, and the other traditional sources of transportation funding have not kept pace with escalating project costs.
Every day, Minnesotans everywhere suffer the consequences of that serious underfunding. Congested freeways. Unsafe two-lane highways. Deteriorating roads and bridges. Inadequate public transit systems. Inadequate transportation systems stifle economic growth and cost jobs.
The future of transportation in Minnesota and the funding for it have to be among the 2015 legislative session's top priorities. Whatever is decided -- whether to do nothing, a little, or a lot -- will have an enormous impact on the lives of all Minnesotans - for decades.
Some say that MnDOT should be looking to save money by becoming more efficient. Well, they have. $50 million in construction savings have been identified that can now be used to advance other important projects, such as a much-needed third lane on Highway 494 in Plymouth.
MnDOT officials have also outlined one possible combination of funds, which could nearly raise the $6 Billion of additional revenues needed over the next ten years to maintain, expand, and improve our state's transportation systems. Obviously, it would be very expensive. It would, however, cost less than doing nothing.

A better Minnesota also means a healthier Minnesota. We can take satisfaction in our national ranking as the third healthiest state. And the Commonwealth Fund has just announced that Minnesota ranks as the best state in the country for health system performance, which includes health care access, quality, costs, and outcomes.
I am especially proud that we've expanded access to affordable, high-quality health care, while at the same time reducing state health care costs. The Department of Human Services has saved taxpayers over $1 Billion through more competitive contracts for our state health care programs.
Among the states, we have the fifth lowest percentage of citizens without health insurance coverage. 8 percent of our residents are uninsured, compared to the national average of 14.8 percent. And our state's entire health care network deserves credit for enabling MNsure to offer the lowest insurance rates of any Health Exchange.
These low rates have helped MNsure enroll over 206,000 Minnesotans in affordable health coverage -- many for the first time. MNsure didn't start well, but it's gotten better, and it will keep on improving.
It's also important to remember that the federal Affordable Care Act provides all Minnesotans with some very important protections, whether they obtain their insurance through MNsure or not. No one can be denied coverage, because of pre-existing conditions. There can be no lifetime limit on a person's health care needs. Young adults are covered under their parents' health insurance plans until the age of 26. Certain screenings for cancer and other preventative procedures are free.
Here in Minnesota, we greatly enhanced the well-being of many of our citizens by passing into law last year's Marriage Equality legislation.
However, there is always more that we can do. Better school physical education programs will encourage children and youths to enjoy physical exercise and appreciate its benefits. The Statewide Health Improvement Program (SHIP) helps people of all ages to become healthy and to stay healthy.
Under SHIP, the Cites of Frazee and Fergus Falls have adopted "Complete Streets" policies, making it easier for residents to incorporate physical activity into their daily routines.
In Fairmont, SHIP has helped community leaders create Safe Routes to Schools. They have installed wider crosswalks, additional safety guards, pedestrian and bike safety education, and a "Walking Tuesday" program at four elementary schools.
Farm to school/ Healthier food programs have taken off under SHIP. In just four years, 29 percent of Minnesota's schools have implemented Farm to School strategies, providing access to locally grown fresh fruits and vegetables to more than 272,000 students.
In Kelliher, for example, SHIP has brought healthier food to the public schools with more fresh fruits and vegetables and more local foods. Kelliher's Superintendent reports that for the first time in 20 years, the school's hot breakfast and lunch budgets are in the black. Last year, at this time, they were between $30,000 and $40,000 in the red.
Healthier habits, lower costs and supporting local economies. That's what SHIP is about.
We also need to support caregivers who are taking care of aging parents. My proposed State Income Tax Credit for Child Care costs would apply equally to the costs of care for dependent, disabled, or elderly family members. I urge that this tax credit be included in the second tax bill.


We must also work continuously to improve government services and provide Minnesotans with the quality and the efficiency they deserve. We have made real progress, and we have much more to do.
We've reduced environmental permitting times, as well as the time it takes the Department of Labor and Industry to license plumbers, electricians and other professionals. And DVS's car registration turnarounds have been slashed from 90 to 19 days.
The Department of Veterans Affairs completely reworked their website, allowing the 490,000 people who visit it each year to more easily access information about veterans' benefits and services. The Department of Natural Resources created a one-stop shop for all State Park camping reservations and license purchases. What used to take campers 11 clicks from the DNR home page to reserve a campsite online. Now it takes only two clicks.
Last year, I recommended that this year's legislative session be the "Unsession." The response has been tremendous! Thousands of Minnesota citizens offered ideas to improve state government at the State Fair, on-line, and in-person.
We also received terrific ideas and suggestions from hundreds of State employees. I thank them for their interest and participation. No one knows better how to improve government services than the people who work provide them. I also thank legislators, who added their own initiatives and who have taken valuable time during this short session to give consideration to the 1000 proposals submitted by my administration.
They all have one goal: to create a Better Government for a Better Minnesota. I have already signed 121 provisions into law. They include the first middle-class tax cut bill, which simplifies the preparation of federal and state taxes, saving one and one-half million Minnesota taxpayers time and money.
This work may not grab news headlines, but it is very important. It is what citizens should rightfully expect from their government. It is what I expect.
I ask the legislature tonight to continue this work and pass the remaining Unsession bills.
While we have made great progress toward a Better Minnesota, it should also serve as a reminder of the work left to do. The middle class is still struggling in our state and all over our country. There is still too much poverty and inequality. There is too much uncertainty and anxiety about the future. Of the 145,000 Minnesotans, who are unemployed, over one-fourth have been without jobs for more than 27 weeks. Nationally, that number is more than a third.
We need more jobs that pay enough to raise families; jobs that have good benefits; that offer retirement security; and keep pace with the cost of living. Too many Minnesotans have to work two or three jobs to try to make ends meet.

We took a very important step two weeks ago, when the legislature increased the state's minimum wage and indexed it to inflation. When fully in effect, 325,000 Minnesotans will earn almost $500 million more every year.
At $8.00 per hour effective this August, a worker's earnings will still be one-third below the federal poverty level for a family of four. At $9.50 per hour in two more years, earnings will remain one-fifth below the poverty level.
Nevertheless, those increases will be enormously important to them and their families. They will use that money to give their children better lives. They will use it to buy necessities, and much will be spent quickly and locally. A higher minimum wage leads to more economic growth by rewarding hard work and improving workers' productivity.
In a couple weeks, I will be speaking for the fourth year at the Minnesota Prayer Breakfast. This year, the theme is "Unity." I am going to say that, unfortunately, where I work, unity in an election year is an oxymoron.
But the truth is . . . we're all in the same boat together. We're all in the same rough seas. We can affect much of what occurs here in Minnesota and improve our state. However, we are part of a very big world.
One which is ever more inter-connected and moving very fast.
Today, the U.S. economy comprises 22% of the entire world economy. In 1960, however, the U.S. share was almost 39%.
Other countries' standings in the global economy have also changed. In the last quarter century, Japan's share of the world's GDP has dropped to half of what it was. China's has increased seven times. Germany's share fell by almost half, while Brazil's more than doubled.
What does this mean? That the world economy is very dynamic, with big winners and losers over time. The U.S. economy is still dominant, but other countries are catching up to us. And they don't want to join us; they want to beat us.
The recent serious recession and slow recovery from it evidence a profound economic change. We used to make here most of what we bought here. And we made it better here than anywhere else in the world. That was our overwhelming competitive advantage, which drove our economic dominance and steadily raised the living standards of our growing middle-class.
In past years, it has shifted. The rest of the world now makes much of what we buy here. However, they cannot yet afford to buy enough of the goods and services we produce here, to replace the jobs that we have lost. And we have not created enough new ideas to launch enough new businesses to provide enough new jobs for everyone who wants and needs one.
This intensified global competition will dominate the rest of our lives, our children's and our grandchildren's lives. How we respond will determine the quality of the lives we all live.
Here in Minnesota, we are better prepared than succeed in this new global economy - because of the ingenuity and productivity found everywhere in our state. From our farmers, who have made Minnesota the 4th largest agriculture exporting state in the nation, to our Iron Range mining companies, who have merged new technology with tried and true methods.
Farmers, steel workers, loggers, plant workers, construction crews, teachers, nurses, truck drivers, corporate executives, and public employees. They are living proof that we have always earned our success. By working harder. By managing better. By innovating smarter. By producing more efficiently. Per capita, we have the highest number of Fortune 500 companies headquartered here. 3M. General Mills. Target. United Health Group. They didn't move here. They started here.
Cargill. Marvin. Andersen. Carlson. Digi-Key. Toro. Schwan's. Polaris. Arctic Cat. Magnetation. Medtronic. Mayo. They, and too many others to mention, began with an entrepreneur with an idea. Which became a product or service. Which other industrious people built into other products and services. Which succeeded, because they were designed well, produced well, and serviced well, by well-educated, talented, and hard-working Minnesotans. Working together, they have produced success after success after success. And they have built a state, which reflects their values and virtues.
That was the key to our past success. It will also be the key to our future success. What we have to do for a better future is what we did for a better past. We have to invest. We have to invest in our people. We have to invest in economic growth. We have to invest in a Better Minnesota.

We have to invest in better education. Education that teaches people what they will need to succeed in the world of the future, not the world of the past. We need to invest in their new ideas, in their new ways to solve problems. We need to invest in their better health. We need to invest in a cleaner environment to keep them healthier for longer. And we need to invest in the infrastructure they need to live productive lives: efficient transportation, reliable sewer and water systems, and high-speed world-communications.
We have begun that process by recognizing the critical importance of our investments in education, and reversing their decline. Increasing our commitment to early childhood education will be one key to closing the achievement gap and enabling all of our children to become successful adults. Let us all commit that by 2018, all three and four year olds in Minnesota will have access to quality, affordable early childhood education.
Then, from the beginning of their elementary school educations, we must teach our children how to think creatively. To learn how to learn. To learn to love to learn. Creative people develop new ideas, which start new enterprises, which provide new jobs. Creative people figure out how to do their work more efficiently and productively.

The excessive amounts of time and rote learning required by today's excessive school testing are counter-productive. They stifle teachers' abilities to not only impart information, but also to show kids how to use it. How to apply their knowledge to solve new problems in new areas. And to enjoy doing so.
This approach does not require abandoning testing, as a measure of each student's progress. It does require more efficient, more effective testing. A growing number of elementary schools in Minnesota are applying "one-minute, read-out-loud" tests, which can determine reading levels in just that one minute. Such tests can be repeated throughout the school year, as often as necessary, to measure students' progress and adjust learning strategies accordingly.
Compare that approach to the high-stakes, anxiety-provoking testing, which is now imposed on children in third grade - or even younger. Many children come to school terrified on test days; then go home demoralized. What purpose does it serve to send a third-grader home believing she has failed life, because she may have performed poorly on a test?
Last year, I'm very sorry to say, our state went backwards. More tests were mandated in the upper grade levels. I'm told some tests are required by state statute. Others are necessary to satisfy federal requirements. Still others are added by local school districts. They may make sense individually; but added all together, they do not.
I am asking our Department of Education to prepare for the 2015 legislative session an analysis all of the tests now required at each grade level. And to recommend which ones could be streamlined, combined, or eliminated. I urge next year's legislators to work with state and national experts to reduce the amount of school testing and allow dedicated teachers to spend their time teaching students what they will need for their future success.
Minnesota offers one of the fewest school days per school year in the country. The amount of time students spend in classrooms each day has also declined. Next year's legislature needs to re-evaluate those practices. The rigors of the school day and the school year are important ways to prepare young people for the far more competitive world they will enter.
We also need to consider what environments we offer young people, when they're not in school. It pains me to drive by a school in the early afternoon and see it closed, with its playground locked up. I always wonder, "Where are the kids, who are locked out of their schools? Where do they go, when they have nowhere to go?"
We need our schools to open earlier to offer their students nutritious breakfasts, and we need them to stay open later to provide safety, mentoring, tutoring, exercise, and new learning opportunities. These additional responsibilities would not be placed upon schools' regular teachers. Instead, a new group of adults would take over after regular hours.
Minnesota has the third highest labor force participation rate in the country: over 70 %. Too many of their sons and daughters have too little to do after school and no one watching them do it. Afternoon and evening programs at schools and recreational centers should be community responsibilities. Ask local businesses to help pay for them. Ask major corporations to sponsor them. Ask adults to volunteer one day a week or a month to run them. Get everyone involved in the lives of our children.
Starting in Junior High School, our education system needs to make students aware of the real world opportunities and pitfalls in the world they will be entering. First and foremost, they need to hear again and again and again that continuing their educations will be absolutely essential to achieving the lives they want. Our schools need more guidance counselors, who are specially trained in career guidance, to help junior high and high school students better understand what their opportunities are and how to prepare for them.
Then we must better align our high school and college curricula with the world of the future, not the world of the past. This means we have to provide leading-edge instruction; in world-class schools, colleges, and universities; with state-of-the-art equipment and technology -- all aligned with the good jobs that will be available for their graduates.
The need for this alignment is well-understood by our state's secondary and post-secondary education leaders. However, they need the resources to carry it out.
The State's current bonding levels do not adequately support the improvements that both MnSCU and the U of M must make in their existing physical plants, in new buildings, and in state-of-the-art equipment and technologies -- to continue to attract the best students and give them the best possible educations.
Higher education is by no means alone in suffering from inadequate capital investments. We need to find new revenues to finance.
I have given special emphasis to education, both because I believe it holds the key to our continued growth. I am convinced that whoever retools their education systems to align most effectively with the world their students will live in, and gives them the tools they will need to succeed in it, will prosper. Whoever doesn't, will lag behind.

We also need to increase our investments in new jobs and better jobs throughout our state. Last year, the legislature made major new investments in the Department of Employment & Economic Development's job creating programs. I thank Speaker Thissen and Majority Leader Bakk for their excellent leadership, and I thank all the legislators of both parties who supported those new incentives.
They are already putting more Minnesotans to work. Since last July, the Minnesota Investment Fund has provided companies with low-interest loans totaling $8.4 million, which have leveraged $235 million in private investment.
In January, the new Minnesota Job Creation Fund was launched. It provides pay-for-performance incentives for businesses to locate or expand here. In its first four months, the program has invested $5 million in 10 different business expansion projects (five in Greater Minnesota and five in the Metro area). It has leveraged $87 million of new, private investments, which have created 550 new jobs.
For this session, I proposed an expansion of our Angel Tax Credit program, our State's primary tool to attract private investments into promising business start-ups and growth. They have the potential to become Minnesota's next Fortune 500 companies. Whether they become large or remain small, their success will drive Minnesota's future economic growth.
As I will say at the Prayer Breakfast, Unity may be beyond our reach at the Capitol this year. I don't want to rule it out entirely, with second tax cut, supplemental budget, and bonding bills still ahead. We might surprise ourselves.
But while we may not find a Unity of Means, I believe we do share a Unity of Purpose. We all love this state. We all want to see it prosper. We want our International communities - there are now over 100 languages and dialects spoken in Minnesota - to retain their special identities; yet, also live together harmoniously and work together productively.
We want Minnesota to be the Best. To be the very best it can possibly be. Because we live here. Many of our children and grandchildren will live here. We want them to achieve the very best they can for themselves and for their families.
In his epic saga Giants in the Earth, O. E. Rolvaag wrote, "By attempting the impossible, they accomplished the unbelievable."
Unity of purpose might seem impossible. But if we try, it might just show up, when we really need it. Today is the 150th anniversary of Confederate General Robert E. Leeâs surrender at Appomattox Court House, which is marked as the end of the American Civil War. It is thus a fitting time to recognize the heroic service of over 24,000 Minnesotans, who fought in that war, and especially the over 2,200 of them, who lost their lives from their service in it.

In his book, entitled The Last Full Measure, Minnesota author, Richard Moe, portrayed soldiers in the First Minnesota Regiment, who sacrificed themselves heroically to protect the Union Armyâs position during the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863. He described them as: âOrdinary young men, who did extraordinary things.â

They were called upon by President Abraham Lincoln to help âSave the Union.â They left their families and homes, suffered unimaginable hardships and horrors, risked their lives, and some gave their lives, to preserve this country for the generations who followed.

We are not being called upon to make such extreme sacrifices. Yet, during the remaining six weeks of this legislative session, we will face our own moments of truth: Will we do what is easy, safe, and popular; or will we risk our political lives to preserve this great state for future generations?

May the First Minnesotaâs courage inspire us. For right now, we have a rare moment of great opportunity. The state of our state is good. Not everywhere. Not for everyone. But overall, Minnesota is doing better than it has for some time, and Minnesota is doing better than most other states. 

What we have been doing is working. Minnesota is working. Our unemployment rate is an unusually low 3.7%. In fact, according to Pew Trustâs research, Minnesota is the only state in the nation, whose employment rate for 25-54 year-olds in 2014 exceeded its pre-recession level in 2007. 

More Minnesota businesses are expanding. So, more Minnesotans are working. They are earning more money, which means they are paying more taxes.

It is that growth in employment, incomes, and profits, not tax increases, that has caused our stateâs biennial budget forecast to go from a $6.2 billion deficit in 2011 to a $1.9 billion surplus today. Income tax rates that apply to 98% of Minnesotans, have remained the same, since I took office. About 2 billion of the $2.1 billion tax increase was paid by the stateâs wealthiest 2% of households, large corporations, and increased tobacco taxes. Those revenues went to cover a projected $627 million deficit and to pay off the $2.8 billion owed our school districts. Then, last year, 2 million Minnesotans received over $500 million in tax cuts.

So, let me repeat: It is Minnesotaâs economic successes, not tax increases, that have produced our present budget surplus.

When it comes to economic success, Minnesota is unique. In most states, a budget surplus is applauded. Going from a deficit to a surplus is seen as a sign that the state is heading in the right direction -- that policymakers are doing things right â so keep it up. 

But not in Minnesota. Here, some people say the reason we have a budget surplus is because weâre doing things wrong.

They say things like: Taxes are too high. They are bloating state revenues, fueling excessive government spending, driving successful businesses and individuals away, and ruining our future.

I have heard that complaint many times, throughout the 38 years I have been involved in Minnesota government. If we have a budget deficit, itâs because taxes are too high. If thereâs a surplus, taxes are too high. Whatever is wrong with Minnesota, taxes are too high.

However, many national experts view our stateâs economic policies and results far more positively than do our in-state critics.

This year, Politico Magazine ranked Minnesota as âThe Best American State.â

Forbes Magazine ranked Minnesota second for âQuality of Life,â third for âBest Place to Make a Livingâ and the ninth âBest State for Business.â

A group called âMichigan Future,â led by some of that stateâs top business and philanthropic leaders, issued a report: âState Policies Matter: How Minnesotaâs Tax, Spending and Social Policies Help it Achieve the Best Economy Among Great Lakes States.â

The report concluded: âThere is no question Minnesota is a high-tax state. â¦ But it has largely invested that additional revenue in services and investments that matter in a knowledge-based economy. An educated workforce, efficient transportation systems, vibrant cities and metropolitan areas, and a secure safety net for those making the transition to a global economy, all matter in creating a prosperous state.â

Closer to home, recent state newspaper headlines have proclaimed:

âManufacturing expansions in Minnesota are booming, creating jobs.

âMore Minnesota manufacturers say they're 'thriving.'â

âNew Product Orders, Hiring Surge in Minnesota.â

And, âOutstate economies are first to recover from the recession.â

As I have said before, the credit for this success belongs to the people of Minnesota. To the business owners and executives, who have chosen to locate and expand here, because they found it profitable to do so. To their hard-working, productive employees, who helped make those decisions successful. To the teachers, professors, and other educators, who provide, overall, the best educations to the most students of any state in the country, as proven again by our top ACT scores for the 9th straight year. To the doctors, nurses, state and local government workers, service providers, lawyers, accountants, computer science experts, and other professionals and their dedicated support staffs.

Unfortunately, our stateâs successes are seldom acknowledged inside this building. Its inhabitants are too preoccupied with assigning blame for real and imagined shortcomings. So, I want to take this opportunity to recognize the accomplishments of the people of Minnesota. And to say, âThank You.â You are remarkable citizens. You have achieved extraordinary successes, which have boosted our state to its place today.

Besides reflecting the truth, a recognition of our stateâs overall success has other benefits. It puts in proper perspective the assessments of our shortcomings, inequities, and areas needing improvement. We still have an unacceptable gap in academic achievement among students of color. There is a widening disparity between the stagnant incomes of middle-class Minnesota families and the wealthiest. Our workplace policies are not giving families the flexibility they need to balance work responsibilities with family responsibilities. The number of people, who depend upon our public healthcare programs, and those programsâ costs, continue to escalate. Both the quality and the capacity of our highway, road, bridge, and public transit systems continue to deteriorate. Our state and federal Constitutions still do not provide Minnesotans with gender equality under the law.

There are also industries in our state, areas of our state, and groups of people with unmet needs. Over 1100 workers at two U.S. Steel plants on the Iron Range are facing imminent layoffs of unknown durations. Minnesota turkey growers have already lost several hundred thousand birds due to an unusual strain of Avian flu. Increasing numbers of our children lack adequate physical protections, emotional support, and alternative homes. They, and others, need and deserve our help. With a $2 billion budget surplus, we can afford to help.

Acknowledging our stateâs overall success also provides more realistic guidance for future decisions, by reframing the debate. Refocused properly, itâs not: What must we do to save our state from disaster? To: What can we do to create an even better future? As I said before, we have a unique opportunity right now, to dedicate our budget surplus to areas of continuing need or to areas that were previously overlooked. 

By illustration, during my 2010 campaign, I proposed that our state fund all-day kindergarten for all Minnesota children. Some questioned school districtsâ interest in providing it; others questioned the need for it; and still others questioned its cost. Finally, in 2013, it passed the legislature, and I signed it into law. At the time, only 54 percent of Minnesotaâs five year-olds were enrolled in a free, all-day kindergarten program. For many of the rest, their parents were paying as much as $4,200 a year to defray the cost. This year, thanks to state funding, 99.6% of Minnesotaâs five year olds are in all-day kindergarten classes, being offered in all but one of our stateâs 954 public elementary school sites.

I thank the school boards, superintendents, principals, teachers, and parents, who responded so enthusiastically and overwhelmingly to this opportunity. And I thank every legislator here tonight, who voted two years ago to make it possible. I expect the reason you seek your job, as do I, is to make lasting improvements in the lives of the people you serve. Well, this time we did, in the lives of young Minnesota children, now and for years to come.

I am frequently asked, âWhat are my top priorities in this session?â My simple, straight answer is: âEverything.â Closing the Achievement Gap; Buffer Zones for Better Water Quality and Wildlife Habitat; Tougher Penalties on Poachers; The Increased Funding requested by the Chief Justice for the Judicial Branch; Completion of the Lewis & Clark Water Project; Final Capitol Restoration; funding for broadband, and all the rest. I would not have proposed any of them, if I didnât believe they were important to a Better Minnesota.

At the very top, however, are education and transportation. They are essential to our future. So, let me go back to education, where I just left off.

In my budget request for the next biennium, I have proposed spending an additional $694.6 million above the February Forecastâs base amount for E-12 education in FY 16-17. In its targets, the Senate has proposed a $361.5 million increase above that base; the House $156.7 million.

A question I hear about my budget proposal is, âMore money for education? But we spend so much already.â

Itâs true that we have significantly increased state funding for K-12 education, since I took office. And I emphasize the word, âWE.â In my first term, the legislature, under both Republican and DFL control, increased state funding for the Per-Pupil Aid Formula, for the Read Well by Third Grade initiative, for Special Education, for School Lunches and for the start of free Elementary School Breakfasts. ALL were enacted with bi-partisan support. So, understandably, some people are asking, âHavenât we done enough?â

However, the most recent Census Bureau report on Public Education Finances ranks Minnesota 24th among the states in Per-Pupil Expenditures for K-12 Education. Our recent increases have lifted our standing, but our financial commitment to educating our children is just average, compared with other states. Just average is not nearly good enough. 

We have the 11th highest per-capita income among the states. A rank of 24th in per-pupil K-12 education expenditures by a state with the 11th highest per-capita income means that at least thirteen other states are making greater financial efforts than we are to educate our children.

The previous decadeâs cuts in education funding are still taking their toll. We can be proud of our bi-partisan improvements over the past four years; but itâs not a reason to stand still. Or to slide backward.

I have also proposed a major new early childhood education initiative to fund pre-kindergarten classes for all of our stateâs four year-olds. Taken on its own, this proposal has the power to transform the trajectory of Minnesotaâs youngest learners. But my proposal doesnât stop there. I am also proposing significant increases in childcare assistance, elimination of the Head Start waiting list, funding for home visiting, more resources to continue building the quality of childcare through Parent Aware, and expanded tax credits to parents for the costs of their child. In the education budget area alone, I am proposing $372 million in additional funding to care for and educate our stateâs children between the ages of 0 to 4 years-old.

I strongly urge the groups now fighting over how that additional funding should be allocated to work cooperatively with the legislature to find the best solution. In my view, itâs not either/or. Itâs both.

At the other end of the education continuum, higher education: the University of Minnesota, the MnSCU colleges, and universities, and state financial aid for students are equally deserving of increased support. In 2013, the legislature approved a $249 million increase in higher education funding for the current biennium. That increase, however, only replaced the $246 million reduction enacted in 2011.

In real, inflation-adjusted dollars, state support for higher education in FY 2012 dropped to its lowest level in over thirty years. No wonder tuitions have been forced higher and higher in both systems, causing Minnesota students to graduate with the fifth highest average debt loads in the country.

The tuition freezes we enacted for last year and this year at the MnSCU and U of M campuses were important steps toward reducing the hardships that high tuitions impose on Minnesota students and their families; but they were only first steps. I am proposing those tuition freezes be continued into the next two years. I also ask the legislature to support needed increases in the stateâs financial aid programs for Minnesota students.

In both my regular budget and bonding bill proposals, I am advocating for increased state support for upgrading the Universityâs Medical School, its Veterinary Research, for new MnSCU programs, as well as $70 million to each system for badly needed repairs on campuses throughout the state. We need those improvements to offer world-class postsecondary educations in world-class facilities. Without them, we wonât be competitive in attracting the students we need for our stateâs future vitality.

I also urge legislators to work even more closely with the Universityâs and MnSCUâs boards, administrators, faculties, and my administration, to identify Minnesota employersâ unmet needs for graduates with specialized skills and determine how best to meet them. I ask each legislator to bring business leaders together with higher education administrators in her or his district; find out how well those campuses are providing the training needed for present and future workforces; and bring solutions to this and future legislative sessions.

The Chief Executive Officers of so many companies have told me that the number one reason why they chose to expand here rather than in other states was the quality of Minnesotaâs workforce, which is also directly related to the quality of their educations. However, the future superiority of our workforce and their productivity is in no way guaranteed. It must be continuously earned.

These and other education initiatives are critically important for many reasons. The quality of our state is, and will be, determined primarily by the quality of our citizens, which will be influenced strongly by the quality of their educations.

All sorts of social measures â from better health, to higher productivity, to lower crime rates â are strongly correlated with levels of educational attainment. The amount of legislative funding for improved education, all the way from early childhood through postsecondary, will measure your commitments to our stateâs future. 

My second top priority for this legislative session is to begin to improve our stateâs aging and inadequate transportation systems, by increasing investments in better highways, roads, bridges, and public transit. For the past twenty-five years, those investments lagged behind what was needed to maintain them, much less to improve them.

I am very pleased that both the Senate and the House have recognized the necessity to make these critically important improvements. However, we still need to reach agreements on the amounts of those investments and how to assure they will continue reliably over the next decade.

It is tempting to allocate a significant amount of the current surplus to fund transportation projects. However, we are unlikely to see surpluses of this magnitude in future years, given the slower pace of this national economic recovery and its vulnerability to unforeseeable world events. Whatever future national economic growth does occur, will likely be less than that experienced in the post-World War II decades, before the Great Recession.

Thus, reallocating General Fund dollars to pay for essential transportation improvements will inevitably pit those needs against educating our children; caring properly for for our elderly; enhancing our natural resources; fulfilling the important promises of the Working Parents Act; and providing quality, affordable health care for all our citizens.

People should not be pitted against projects. Both are too important.

There are other needed infrastructure improvements throughout our state. Our budget surplus provides us with opportunities to invest in better public buildings; athletic and cultural facilities; advanced communication networks; water quality and wildlife habitat improvements; and state parks and trails, all of which make vital contributions to our stateâs quality of life. They enhance our appeal to current retirees, Baby Boomer near-retirees, Generation Xers, Millennials, and generations still unnamed -- all of whom will ask themselves: What does this state offer to me? To my family? My career success? My recreation? My safety? And so much more.

Talented, successful people can choose where they want to live. We are in competition for them with the rest of our country and the rest of the world. It would be, as the old saying goes: âPenny Wise and Pound Foolish,â not to increase our investments in a Better Minnesota by passing a bonding bill this year.

Some people are telling us to âJust wait until next yearâ for my $842 million bonding bill. That just doesnât make sense. Interest rates remain low; we have capacity for the debt service within existing guidelines; and many of those and other improvements are urgently needed.

How can we tell the citizens and businesses in Worthington to âjust wait another yearâ for a reliable supply of safe drinking water? Or tell people in Willmar to âwait another yearâ before rerouting rail cars with volatile fuels away from their city; or St. Cloud area residents to âwait another yearâ for public safety improvements to the nearby correctional facility?

The legislature has passed a bonding bill in 31 of the past 32 sessions â in both even- and odd-numbered years. Waiting now, for another year, is inexplicable and should be unacceptable.

I am also unwilling to wait another year â or longer â for legislation that will significantly improve Minnesotaâs water. Some lakes, rivers, and streams all over our state have become dangerously polluted â so bad that fish canât live in them and people shouldnât swim in them. One Minnesotan living in a town providing free bottled water to its residents after its water treatment plant malfunctioned, said, âthatâs just the way it is, living here.â

I disagree. That should not be âjust the way it is,â living anywhere in Minnesota. No one person or industry is responsible for our stateâs deteriorating water quality; but every one of us is responsible for improving it.

Yet, the headline in this weekâs Outdoor News reads: âBuffer Bill has No Futureâ in this legislative session. I find that hard to believe and impossible to accept. You ARE the billâs future. Passing it is your responsibility.

If all the interest groups, who oppose my bill, spent half as much time improving it as they do criticizing it, it would have passed already. My initial proposal is condemned for being âOne size fits all.â Well then, tell us how many sizes, in what shapes, as determined by whom, will fit all?

Everyone professes to want clean water. Too many, however, donât want to do whatâs necessary to get it. And everyone means not just farmers, but also municipalities, industries, landowners, and everyone else. Itâs time for all of us to work together to pass a bill this session that will protect our citizens from polluted water.  

In closing, our continued success wonât just happen. We must make it happen. We must invest what we have now to improve what we do have. And to correct whatâs missing.

That wonât happen by distributing our surplus to each of our constituents. Thatâs what a corporate board does, when theyâre breaking up the enterprise. They cash it out, distribute it to their stockholders, close the doors, and go home.

Minnesotaâs success will continue, if we do what successful farmers, business owners, homeowners, and other franchise owners do â pool our resources, invest them wisely, and create an even more prosperous future.

We will be judged by what we do. This is our moment of truth. Minnesotaâs future is now in our hands. How will future historians judge our wisdom, our innovation, and our courage? I believe historians will judge us the way we, as parents, judge ourselves: have we passed onto our children the opportunities for a better life? Are we leaving Minnesota a better place for our children â a state with more opportunities, an even better natural environment, and an education that ensures that each of our children will have a real chance for success? Over the next six weeks, we will answer those questions. I want our answer to be âyes â we leave the children of Minnesota that chance for a better life.
